Your body goes limp and slumps over  Like A Rod in a month lull  but he just homered    Hold up  I said Rover because now your Rover is red  Like Red Rover  so you know what I meant  But I roll over my opponents instead  Makin  dog sounds  cause I gotta keep breakin  these bars down  I ll go slow for the speds  But when I go (roof) like the doberman said  I still think the (roof) would go over your head (haha)  Beast mode  motherfuckers  bout to get hit with so many foul lines  You think I m a free throw  Figured it was about time for people to eat crow  You about to get out rhymed  how could I be dethroned   I stay on my toes like the repo  a behemoth in sheep clothes  From the East Coast to the West  I m the ethos and I m the G O A T  Who the best  I don t gotta say a fuckin  thing  though   cause MC s know    But you don t wanna hear me spit the facts  Your shit is ass like a tailbone  And you re trapped in your cell phone  On my chicken scratch  or my self loathe  I don t want to fuckin  listen to you spit your rap someone else wrote  Used to get beat up by the big kids  Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel  And I wouldn t do shit but just sit still  Now money s not a big deal  I m rich  I wipe my ass with six mil   Big bills like a platypus  A caterpillar s comin  to get the cannabis  I m lookin  for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin   Batterin  everything and I ve had it with the inadequate  Man  I can see my dick is standin  stiff as a mannequin  And I m bringin  the bandana back  and the fuckin  headband again  A handkerchief and I m thinkin  of bringin  the fuckin  fingerless gloves back  And not giving a singular f ck  like f ck rap    I sound like a fuckin  millionaire  With the Derringer with a hair trigger   Bout to bear hug it  fuckin  terrier  the Ric Flair dripper  Y all couldn t hold a candle at a prayer vigil  When I vent  they compare me to a fuckin  air duct  I m about to bare knuckle it  nah  f ck it  I m gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket  abraca fuckin  dabra  The track is the blood  I m attracted  I m attackin  it  What  Dracula  f ck that shit  I m up  back with a thud  Man  stop    Look what I m plannin   plannin   I m plannin  to  Do all this while you panickin   And you re lookin  and starin  at mannequins  And I m goin  to Fanagan s  tryin  to get up a plan against  All of the blana kazana ka fam bam bannigans  While of all the bana kazanika Hanna in a cabana  You re in a cab  I m in a cabana and a Janet  I m in a cabana chantin  all this stand up banter  While you don t got the stamina  you re lackin  the stamina  You re lackin  the stamina while you re divorcin  Harrison Ford  And I m in a Porsche on the floor boards  While I m world tourin   You usin  way too many napkins  papkins  lapkins and chapki  You using ChapStick and napkins while I m papkin   Flappin  around like a bapkin   Flammina babbita playin  a jampkin  Dammit  a can of pa,Eminem

4,You will not be able to stay home brotha  You will not be able to plug in  turn on and cop out  You will not be able to lose yourself on scag and skip out for beer during commercials  Because the revolution will not be televised    This right here for the number ones  Number ones here with your number one  You ain t number one  just another one  Now everybody sayin  that they number one    Ring the alarm  the caterpillar keeps firing  Oh  we in the war  Where butterflies keep dyin  (ah)    I m a product of Parker  Lewis and Kubiak  If didn t do this  where in the f ck would you be at   See there s a difference between us  what I spit hit arenas  You a drip from my penis  I eat lion and sip hyenas  You number one when it comes to slaughtered mics  I m tryna be number one in my son and daughter life  Uh  all you niggas my lil  rapper babies  Y all my children  y all bit my shit and contracted rabies  Don t you grade me next to these rapper  baby  that s degrading  My style got so many different facets  I switch into so many different passions  I m skippin  class to be fascinating  My pen is like Big Ben  this shit s just a classic waiting  Your favorite rapper come at me  I just decapitate him  Out here congratulating these has beens who had their highs  These rappers only won their matches because they strategize  I ll bring adequate to these patterns and here s my battle cry    Ring the alarm  the caterpillar is firing  Oh  we in the war  Where butterflies keep dyin  (ah)    This right here for the number ones  Number ones here with your number one  You ain t number one  just another one  Now everybody sayin  that they number one    Here take your number one  quit  Number one soul  get your number one chip  Number one fly with your number one kicks  When it s all done then your number gon  switch    Hold up  wait a minute  Guess what I ma never do  Show so much respect to you  That I feel like we re friends  so now we no longer competitors  That could be the death of you  Never let someone who s not as smart as you gas you up  And tell you somethin  you never knew  Always stay professional  You always gon  make revenue  Don t let people next to you that don t want the best for you  It s completely normal to hold on to what we re retracting to  I do what I want to do  they do what I let them do  Everything niggas be sayin  is a fuckin  lie  There

number one  You ain t number one  just another one  Now everybody sayin  that they number one  Here take your number one  quit  Number one soul  get your number one chip  Number one fly with your number one kicks  When it s all done then your number gon  switch    You lookin at Atilla  The psychopathic killer  the caterpillar  Don t tell me when I m supposed to rap until  Especially when your favorite rapper isn t even half as ill  A savage still  the tracks a banana peel  attack of the silverback gorilla  You havin  a little trouble fathomin  this is actually happenin   Like Anderson Silva when he snapped his shin in half   And then had shit hangin  by a flap of skin   After he tried to plant the shit back on the mat again  Pad to pen I’m batty like eyelids when they re blinkin  a lot  You copy me  but you re not  You can t be butterflies  My offspring s are just moths  If I see that thing  I ma squash it and rip the wings of it off  So ring the alarm  pull the extinguishers off of the wall  set the sprinklers off  Like Jada Pinkett and Queen Latifah   til the shingles come off the roof  We ll shatter the ceilings  Slaughterhouse in the building  middle fingers aloft  Say what I think when I rhyme  in ink pen I talk  And the language I speak is my mind  Kingpin and Penguin combined  Spit like it s King of the Dot  A singular thought I d think I would help you distinguish  A brother from the cream of the crop  Wait a minute  hold up  Like a flash card  Damn dog  is that copyin   or payin  homage   It s sad because dad taught you to rap as a damn toddler  My dad is your grandfather  I have to rehatch on you  Come back as black wasp  Half yellow jacket  you can t swat a  Sasquatch dancin  on top of a Ant    Trample it and stomp it  smash it and stand on it  Dammit  I can t stop it  The rap is a vag and I can t stop goin  in like a tampon in this bitch  It s is manslaughter  Stampin  out grasshoppers  you can t be no Rap Gods  In fact you re exact opposites  You make a wack song  and can t hold a candle  But even Daniel san wax off  you jack offs  Need to come to grips  like a hand job  The boom bap is back with an axe to mumble rap  Lumberjack with a hacksaw  Number one  but my pencils are number two  cause that s all I do with  em  Poop is my pseudonym  On the john like a prostitute when I droppin  a deuce and  When I m producing them lyrical bowel movements  These beats are like my saloons   Cause these bars always got my stools in  em  And I don t need Metamucil to loosen them  Bitch it is real like I pooped Jerusalem  I m  bout to go spin another cocoon   And I m cuttin  you from your mother s womb and I m bustin  you,Eminem
5,Yeah  yo I m just gonna write down my first thoughts   And see where this takes me     Cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin  face right now    Yeah  let me explain just how to make greatness  Straight out the gate  I m  bout to break you down  Ain t no mistakes allowed  but make no mistake I m  bout  To rape the alphabet  I may raise some brows  If I press the issue just to get the anger out (brrr)  Full magazine could take Staples out  Savage  but ain t thinking  bout no bank account  But bitch I m off the chain like Taylor Brown  Motherfucker  shut the f ck up when I m talkin   lil  bitch  I m sorry  wait  what s your talent  Oh  critiquin   My talent  Oh  bitch  I don t know who the f ck y all are  To give a sub par bar  even have an opinion of you  You mention me  millions of views  attention in news  I mention you  lose lose for me  win win for you  Billions of views  your ten cents are two  Skim through the music to give shit reviews  To get clicks  but bitch  you just lit the fuse  Don t get misconstrued  business as us   Shit list renewed so get shit to do  Or get dissed  cause   I just don t get what the f ck half the shit is that you re listening to  Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow  Everyone copies though  Probably no  Get this fuckin  audio out my Audi yo  adios  I can see why people like Lil  Yachty  but not me though  Not even dissin   it just ain t for me  All I am simply is just an emcee  Maybe  Stan  just isn t your cup of tea  Maybe your cup s full of syrup and lean  Maybe I need to stir up shit  Preferably shake the world up if it were up to me  Paul wants me to chill  y all want me to ill  I should eat a pill  probably I will  Old me kill the new me  watch him bleed to death  I breathe on the mirror  I don t see my breath  Possibly I m dead  I must be possessed  Like an evil spell  I m E V I L (evil  but spelled)  Jam a Crest white strip in the tip of my dick with an ice pick  Stick it in a vice grip  hang it on a spike fence  Bang it with a pipe wrench  While I take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch  Like vice president Mike Pence  Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip  These are things that I d rather do than hear you on a mic  Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and  Jesus Christ man  how many times is someone gonna f ck on my bitch    (F ck my side chick )  You won t ever see Em icy  but as cold as I get on the M I C  I polarize shit so the Thames might freeze  And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it  Bitch I got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah)  Turn down for what  I ain t loud enough  Nah  turn the valium up    Cause I don t know how I m gonna get your mouths to shut  Now when it doesn t matter what caliber I spit at  I ll bet a hundred thousand bucks  You ll just turn around and just be like   Man  how the f ck  Sourpuss gonna get mad just  cause his album sucks  And now he wants to take it out on us   (Ooh ooh)  But last week  an ex fan mailed me a copy  Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study  It ll help me get back to myself and she ll love me (ooh ooh)  I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that  I d just be like everyone else in the fucking industry  Especially an effing Recovery clone of me  So finger bang  chicken wang  MGK  Iggy  Zae  Lil  Pump  Lil  Xan imitate Lil  Wayne  I should aim at everybody in the game  pick a name  I m fed up with being humble  And rumor is I m hungry  I m sure you heard bumblings  I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach  I heard your mumblin  but it s jumbled in mumbo jumbo  The era that I m from will pummel you  That s what it s comin  to  What the f ck are you gonna do  Where you runnin  to   I m gonna crumble you and I ll take a number two  And dump on you if you ain t Joyner  If you ain t Kendrick or Cole or Sean then you re a goner  I m  bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it  I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper  You can order a quarter pounder when you go to McDonald s  But if you re lookin  to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival  But y all are acting like I tried to serve you up a slider  Maybe the vocals should have been auto tuned  And you would have bought it  But sayin  I no longer got it   Cause you missed the line and never caught it   Cause it went over your head  because you re too stupid to get it   Cause you re mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest  With your expertise and knowledge  but you ll never be an artist  And I m harder on myself than you could ever be regardless  What I ll never be is flawless  all I ll ever be is honest  Even when I m gone they re gonna say I brought it  Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin  alcoholic  With a bottle full of malt liquor  But I couldn t bottle this shit any longer  The fact that I know that I ma hit my bottom  If I don t pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet  I don t see why y all even started with me  I get impeached  my enemies die  I don t ceasefire  til at least all are deceased  I m eastside  never be caught slippin   Now you see why I don t sleep  Not even a wink  I don t blink  I don t doze off  I don t even nod to the beats  I don t even close my fuckin  eyes when I sneeze   Aw  man  That BET cypher was weak  it was garbage  The Thing ain t even orange—oh my God  that s a reach    Shout to all my colorblind people  each and every one of y all  If you call a fire engine green  aquamarine  Or you think water is pink   Dawg  that s a date    Looks like an olive to me     Look  there s an apple    No it s not  it s a peach    So finger bang  Pootie Tang  Burger King  Gucci Gang  Mookie  dang  Charlamagne gonna hate anyway  Doesn t matter what I say  Give me Donkey of the Day  What a way for 2018 to get underway  But I m gonna say everything that I wanna say  Welcome to the slaughterhouse  bitch (yeah)  Invite them in like a one a day  I m not done (preach)   Cause I feel like the beast of burden  That line in the sand  was it even worth it    Cause the way I see people turnin   Is makin  it seem worthless  It s startin  to defeat the purpose  I m watchin  my fan base shrink to thirds  And I was just trying to do the right thing  but word  Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict  Or still yet to be determined    Cause I m determined to be me  critique the worship  But if I could go back I d at least reword it  And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent  Sold the dream to that he s deserted  But I think it s workin   These verses are makin  him a wee bit nervous  And he s too scurred to answer me with words   Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered  But I know at least he s heard it   Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service  To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin  him  Or ask if I m linked to terrorists  I said   Only when it comes to ink and lyricists   But my beef is more media journalists  (Hold up  hold up  hold up)  I said my beef is more meaty  a journalist  Can get a mouthful of flesh  And yes  I mean eating a penis   Cause they been pannin  my album to death  So I been givin  the media fingers  Don t wanna turn this to a counselling sesh  But they been puttin  me through the ringer  So I ain t ironin  shit out with the press  But I just took this beat to the cleaners,Eminem

I ve been alone  I never needed nobody  Just only me and my shotty  I ll tell these niggas to lie down  Keep all of the money  I never wanted the lifestyle  I just pray to God that my son ll be alright now  I said ain t no love for the other side  Or anyone who ever want smoke  When I die I m goin  out as the underdog who never lost hope  You in the wrong cab down the wrong path  Nigga wrong way  wrong road  Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast  I just bought a fuckin  lawn mower    I have said a lotta things in my day  I admit it  This is payback in a way  I regret it that I did it  I done won a couple Grammys but I sold my soul to get  em  Wasn t in it for the trophies  just the fuckin  recognition  F ck s the difference   I m that cracker  bend the law  f ck the rules  Man I used

mansions  Still I don t have any manners  You got a couple of ghost writers  But to these kids it don t actually matter  They re askin  me  What the f ck happened to hip hop    I said  I don t have any answers    Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album  It hurt me like hell but I m back on these rappers  And actually coming from humble beginnings  I m somewhat uncomfortable winning  I wish I could say  What a wonderful feeling    We re on the upswing like we re punchin  the ceiling  But nothin  is stealing like anyone has any fuckin  ability  To even stick to a subject  it s killin  me  the inability to pin humility  Hatata batata  why don t we make a bunch of fuckin   Songs about nothin  and mumble   And f ck it  I m goin  for the jugular  Shit is a circus  you clowns that are comin  up  Don t give an ounce of a motherfuck  About the ones that were here before you to make raps  let s recap  Way back  MC s that recap and tape decks  Eight DATs with the G raps and Kane s hat  We need 3 Stacks ASAP  and bring lap Masta Ace back  Because half of these rappers have brain damage  All the lean rappin   face tats  syruped out like tree sap  I don t hate trap  and I don t wanna seem mad  But in fact with a old me at the same cat that would take that  Feedback and aim back  I need that  But I think it s inevitable  That you re a button to press or a lever to pull  They give me the snap though (lil  bitch)  And if I paid attention I d probably makin  it big  But you ve been takin  the dicks  In the fuckin  back  ho (get it )  On the brink  any minute  Got me thinkin  of finishin  everything  With acetaminophen then reapin  the benefits  I ma sleep at the wheel again  As I peak into thinkin  about an evil intent  Of another beat  I ma kill again   Cause even if I gotta end up eatin  a pill again  Even ketamine or methamphetamine  With the Manidon  it better be at least 70 to 300 milligram  And I might as well  cause I ma end up bein  a villain again  Levels to this shit I got an elevator  You could never say to me I m not a fuckin  record breaker  I sound like a broken record every time I break a record  Nobody could ever take away the legacy  I made a navigator  Motherfucker never got a right to be this way  I got spite inside my DNA  But I work  til the wheels fall off  I m workin  tirelessly  ay  It s the moment y all been waitin  for  Like California wishin  rain would pour  And that drought y all have been prayin  for  My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw  Still the same Marshall that outlaw  That they say is a writer might ve fell off  But back on that bull like the cowboys    So y all gotta move (yeah)  y all gotta move (yeah)  y all gotta move  Give me some room  give me some room  give me the juice  Hop out the coupe  hop out the coupe  how  bout I shoot   Y all gotta move  y all gotta move  give me the juice,Eminem

13,It s 2002  everything was totally new  We were globally huge  watching sales go through the roof  We wrote and we viewed it  Runyon Avenue soldiers included  A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse  We were so bulletproof  wrote  souped and soaked in our youth  Thought we was runnin  shit  til we lost the sole of our shoe  The death of Doody broke us in two  We were thrown for a loop  ain t none of us know what to do  And at the time I was goin  through my own struggles too  So I wasn t in no condition to be coachin  us through  Everyone tried to go solo  really nobody blew  I was hopin  they do so I ain t have to shoulder the group  The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew  How to stand on they own and I don t want to open up wounds  I just noticed the oomf was gone when we go in the booth   Cause the truth is  the moment that Proof died  so did the group    If I could leave this world behind  I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line  Turn to the river with you  Help me leave this all behind    I ma wash away my sins  I ma rinse away this dirt  I forgot to make amends  To all the friends I may have hurt  I better stop and say my grace  From that I pray that I don t fall   Cause on the way back down I may  End up runnin  back into them all  I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones    It was never the same  and it s bothered me since  And the farther we drift apart  the more awkward it gets  The more time goes by  the more life happens  And we gotta be men  we got responsibilities  Plus we don t say how we feel  and I feel like this is what got us in  The debacle we re in  been with you guys thick and thin  But it s almost as if sometimes we re not even friends  Which reminded me Biz  Rockstar was the shit  Y all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit  If you ve put D12 on it  wish I coulda did  More than try talkin  you into comin  up off of it  I know it wasn t my fault  but part of it probably is  I think of all of the trips to BET and the rappers  I wish that we woulda politicked with  Maybe y all coulda clicked and got you some features  But that s water under the bridge  But I m washin  my sins in it  til my conscience is clear    If I could leave this world behind  I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line  Turn to the river with you  Help me leave this all behind    I ma wash away my sins  I ma rinse away this dirt  I forgot to make amends  To all the friends I may have hurt  I better stop and say my grace  From that I pray that I don t fall   Cause on the way back down I may  End up runnin  back into them all  I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones    Bacardi in hand  never thought the party would end  One minute you re bodyin  shit  but then your audience splits  You can already sense the climate is startin  to shift  To these kids you no longer exist  Went from rainin  cats and dogs in this bitch  To tiny drops full of drips  And by the time your reign is over  you ll hardly be missed  You start thinkin  of all the artists you gift  all the carnage you left  Is this the kinda karma you get  For turnin  your fuckin  back on Bizzy  Kuniva and Swift   A Freudian slip  subconsciously  I honestly wished  I ain t feel so much guilt and y all didn t harbor resentment  But it s hard to pretend that y all ain t got none of this  Wish I had words    But I guess they re just honored for this  Still  my point is I just can t say how sorry I am  This is not how I planned for our story to end  I love all of you  men  But I just can t be the guy  Everybody depends on for entire careers   Cause that s not even fair  I will always be here  but that spark isn t there  And I don t know how to recapture that time and that air  I ve tried hearkening back to but I m fighting for air  I m barely chartin  myself  Feels like I m under the sink  but it was not my intent    To treat y all like a stepping stone  Though I ain t left no one behind  But we been down every road  done all we possibly can  I know we kept our hopes up  But the longer we spend livin  this lie that we live  The less is left for closure  so let s let this go  It s not goodbye to our friendship  but D12 is over    I ma wash away my sins  I ma rinse away this dirt  I forgot to make amends  To all the friends I may have hurt  I better stop and say my grace  From that I pray that I don t fall   Cause on the way back down I may  End up runnin  back into them all  I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones  I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones  I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones,Eminem

33,And I started from the bottom  like a  Snowman  ground up  like round chuck   And still put hands on you  stayin  wound up  That s how I spin time  sucker free  confidence high  Such a breeze when I pin rhymes  I just got that air about me  like wind chimes  Another day in the life  used to have to scrape to get by  Now my community is gated and I made it and my neighbors say hi  I m givin  em pounds  I m upscale now  Guess it means I m way in the sky  But I still remember the days off  Minimum wage for  general labor  Welfare recipient as a minor  Look for government assistance has made you  Adversity if at first shit don t succeed  Put your temper to more use  cause being broke is a poor excuse  That should only give you more fuel  Show  em why you re you  So close  got it s like a  almost  Got it  but close only counts in time bombs and horse shoes  So I uni bomb shit (tick  tick  tick)  No remorse  Screw it  I m lit  and that s the attitude I blew up on  That s why they call me firecracker  I grew up on wick (wick  wick  wick) with a short fuse  I got some important news to report to  Anyone who thought I was done  nah  bitch  not quite  Spotlight s back on  got my faith  where s yours     Do you still believe  In me   Didn t I get everything I had to give you to make you see   I never forget if you turn your back on me  Now and walk out I will never let you live it down  Do you still believe  I ll never quit  In me     Man I know some times these thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice  To me  there s just ink blots  I just fling them like slingshots  and so precise  So you might want to think it over twice  When you retards can roll the dice  But beef can at least cost you your career  Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced  But this middle finger is free as a bird  New warhead ed birth  you just forehead ed on earth  Too short for a verse  studied his formula  Learned how to incorporate a curse  Point it towards corporate america  Stick a fork in it and turn   Cause four letter words are more better  Heard the world force fed a turd to me  You re getting yours  But sometimes I overdo it  But I just get so into it  I was there consulting when no one knew it  When your situation showed no improvement  I was that door  you walked over to it  I m the light at the tunnel so people are always looking at me when they re going through it  When that tunnel vision is unclear shit becomes too much to bear  Since  Cleaning Out My Closet  when I was having trouble with the snare  I m that unrealistic prayer answered  I m going to get you jacked up  like you re trying to fix a flat (uh)  When you struggle with a spare  That double fisted bear  knuckles coupled with the spare  Nuts  I m cuppin  I am your f ck it switch nothing can compare    Do you still believe  In me   Didn t I get everything I had to give you to make you see   I never forget if you turn your back on me  Now and walk out I will never let you live it down  Do you still believe  I ll never quit  In me     Started from the bottom like a snowman  Oh man  put that in your corncob pipe  and smoke that  But my battery is low  I m gonna need a booster in my pack  I know I always got Proof on my back  I called you a groupie cause I knew for a fact  My ace in the hole  homie  I m calling on you  cause I think I m slowly  Startin  to lose faith in it so  give me that inkling and  Motivation to go  who s insane with the flow  Fake fans with the two faced that show  Let heartbeat produce hate in my soul  Laying vocals two days in a row  True statement  hate to go down this road  But there s only one route to cross this bridge  So I walk in this bitch with loose chains   Cause all I dues paid  But this booth is taking its toll  But it s never too late to start a new beginning  So that goes for you too  So what the f ck you gon  do  use the tools you re given  Or are you going to use the cards you were dealt as an excuse to not do shit with them  I used to play the loser victim  Until I saw the way Proof was driven  I found my vehicle and I haven t ran out of gas yet  And when they stack decks  turn handicaps into assets  Fanny packs  hourglasses  If time was on my side I d still have none to waste  Man  in my younger days  that dream was so much fun to chase  It s like I run in place while this shit dangled in front of my face  But how do you keep up the pace and the hunger pains when you ve won the race  When that pool of exhaust is cooling off   Cause you don t got nothing left to prove at all   Cause you already hit them with the coup de gras  Still you feel the need  To go through and deal with that Bruce Will  It s that blue steel  that true skill  When that wheel s loose I won t loose will  Do you still believe ,Eminem
34,Hands up  officer don’t shoot  Then pull your pants up  promise you won t loot  We may never understand each other  it’s no use  We ain’t ever gonna grasp what each other goes through    Black boy  black boy  we ain t gonna lie to you  Black boy  black boy  we don t like the sight of you  Pull up on the side of you  Window rolled down   profile   Then we wonder why we see this side of you  Probably comin  from the dope house  We could let you slide but your tail light is blew  out  We know you re hidin  that Heidi Klum  On you another drug charge  homie  it s back inside for you  And just in case a chase might ensue  we got that tried and true  Pistol drew right at you  we d be delighted to unload it  In your back  then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you  Fucked up  but what the f ck am I to do   I keep tellin  myself  keep doin  like you re doin   No matter how many lives you ruin  It s for the red  white and blue  Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two  No one s ever indicted you  Why   Cause you re a    White boy  white boy  you re a rockstar  (My momma talkin  to me  tryna tell me how to live)  White boy  white boy  in your cop car  (But I don t listen to her   cause my head is like a sieve)  White boy  white boy  you re untouchable  (The world s coming to an end  I don t even care)  Nobody can tell me shit  cause I m a (big rockstar)    Black boy  black boy  we don t get your culture and  We don t care what our government s done to f ck you over  man  Don t tell us your attitude s a result of that  Balderdash  where’d you get the chip on your shoulder at   Why you kicking that soda can   Pull your pants up  we  bout to roll up and  Throw your ass in the van cuffed  You don t have to know our plans or what our intentions are  Our cards are close to our chest  you better show your hands  And put our minds more at ease  Or get shot in the thyroid  comply or die  boy  We re fightin  a crime war  here come the swine  Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities  That s what we call  em pigsties for  They re like eyesores to police  Talk to you like just a piece of trash  Feels like we re stuck in a time warp to me  As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions  As this beat backspins  it s like we re drifting back in  To the sixties  having black skin is risky   Cause this keeps happening  Throughout history  African Americans have been treated like shit  And I admit  there have been times where it s been embarrassin  to be a    White boy  white boy  you re a rockstar  (My momma talkin  to me  tryna tell me how to live)  White boy  white boy  in your cop car  (But I don t listen to her   cause my head is like a sieve)  White boy  white boy  you re untouchable  (The world s coming to an end  I don t even care)  Nobody can tell me shit  cause I m a (big rockstar)    Seems like the average lifespan of a white man  Is more than twice than a black life span  I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner  I feel like checking out on life  can t escape this circumstance  I d rather hear  em say  Die N word  than Die Antwoord  Ninja  now it s better disguised banter  But that s life  strapped  cause we re strapped financially  And can t find answers  We re applying  but McDonald s  Seems to be the only franchise that ll hire  So how can we have higher standards   As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter  We fight back with violence but acts like that are  Black eyes on the movement  Which makes black lives madder  At cops and cops madder  That s why it s at a stalemate  Can t arrive at a compromise so it s Black Ops  I wonder if we hire more black cops  the crap stops  The block is our backyards  officers  not the crack spot  Call the attack dogs off of us  man  You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop  And bad cops f ck it up for the good cops  and man  stop  Sendin  white cops in the black neighborhoods  Who ain t acclimated to  em  like that s the way to do it  Who seen some fuckin  videos of rappers waving guns  And know nobody black so they act afraid of us  And that s racism  the fear that a black face gives  em  A subconscious racist  Wait  why are there black neighborhoods    Cause America segregated us  designated us to an area  Separated us  Section Eight d us  When we tear it up’s the only time attention’s paid to us  And education sucks  and every day s another  Freddie Gray for us  a levy breaks or fuzz  Why is it they treat us like dryer lint   We just want a safe environment for our kids  But can’t escape the sirens  Don’t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in  The poverty that we face so the crime rate’s the highest in  The lowest classes  it s like a razor wire fence  And we’re trapped in these racial biases  That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise  Every time we see a devil’s face  Lions  tigers  and bears  oh my  It s more like billy clubs and gats  And we really love it when you think we’re guilty ‘cause we’re black   But you kill each other  facts  You peel each other s caps  for silly stuff like hats”  Single mother strugglin’ through substance abuse  While people with nothin  to lose shoot each other for shoes  F ck your Republican views  Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps  where the f ck are the boots   And streets act as a narrator  don t gotta read comics  Or be that into characters  just to see that  just to be black  You better be strapped with a derringer  Or be “capped in America” like Steve Rogers   Cause no one oversees these cops and  All we see is  em beat charges  We done seen  em beat Rodney King unconscious  and got off  So we don t need all you crooked police officers  peace offerings  Just keep marchin    til we reach congress  But they re gonna say you re tryin  to take an irrational stance  If you try to slander the flag but  Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb  So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum  If you don t stand for the national anthem  We raise it  you better praise it  Or you ll be made to feel like a traitor  we ll  Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield  Home of the brave is still racist  ville  So this whole nation feels like a plantation field  In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals  That had its Natives killed  Got you singin  this star spangled spiel  To a piece of cloth that represents the  Land of the Free  that made people slaves to build,Eminem

hotel lobby a lil  wobbly and still groggy  This blonde fucks reprehensible misconducts  never sensible  Kiss my butt  my set of principles is gone  But  til I get the President to respond  My pen and pencil is a missile launcher  And send it to Mitch McConnell  Just as big of a bitch as Donald  Shit s on  bruh  Let me sing this shit soprano  While I do it pizzicato  Ivanka  stiff arm her  While I m hittin  on Melania  And this song s for all ya     Cause nobody likes me  everybody hates me  They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)  And drag my name through the mud  through the dirt  But I ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)  You can try to hold me down  but you better let me up   Cause you re only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)   Cause I pray when I get up I m never gonna let up   Til everybody eats my turds    These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me  Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery  Goin  ham at candy yam on nanny cam  I m gettin  handys with the Xanny Xannys in the Caddy armrest  I m imagining objects  so I m batting cobwebs  From a daddy longleg  In Hamtramck  got the panoramic camera  Xanax  a banana hammock and a Santa hat  I m smellin  like a damn mechanic  With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent  Twice your age and I m actin  half it  Grow up  Nah  Not that I know of  y all  Basement just got a frickin  overhaul  got a stripper pole installed  Started rollin  all through those Kolonopins like a bowlin  ball  Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol and go through no withdrawal  While I get fellatio and give a facial to an interracial blow up doll  a Rachel Dolezal  You re so appalled  (Em) so s my manager  Bitch I m amateur  f ck a pro career  Coast is clear  but nowhere to go from here  And nobody s close  so don t compare  They ain t nowhere near  I m way over here  My competition can t see me   Cause I don t own a mirror  But Marshall  you are terrific  so smart and gifted  I m so narcissistic  when I fart  I sniff it  Do a fake dab to smell my armpits with it  Your anxiety s throwin  gang signs  But I made strides with these rape lines  I m cuttin  back on women hate crimes  Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes  Bang  bang  bang  bang time  Dang knives to butcher them gay wives  You re gonna need sutures the same size  As the blade I push in to kaputt you when I  Pull  em like  sleigh rides  Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times  To make it on Dateline  And I came to stake my claim like a canine  Waitin  in a buffet line  So Kellyanne Conway  I m a really bad hombre  Come play  belly dance on me  I ve been making wedding plans all day     Cause nobody likes me  everybody hates me  They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)  And drag my name through the mud  through the dirt  But I ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)  You can try to hold me down  but you better let me up   Cause you re only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)   Cause I pray when I get up I m never gonna let up   Til everybody eats my turds    Eight year old with the wordplay  Girl  take this pole like a survey  Today wasn t my birthday  But I m caked up like a dessert tray  So we re in shape   Cause you re in a slurrin  state  I m a 10  you re an 8  Like what I do before  after  and during rape  You wanna get into a pissin  contest and find out who s better   And they made a fool out of what I pulled out him  R  Kelly with a full bladder  Not in high school  grad  I m not a scholar  But I m so cold that I m droppin  out with my degrees  It s the same as I got in college (zero)  But nobody s hotter  you owe me my respect  I owe you nada like lodi partner  blow me  Told you I m so dirty  homie you can throw me in some holy water  With some floaties on  And get to soakin   try to get to poke the hole in  While you hose me off  and nope I won t be washed  You hope to God I don t explode  I gotta blow this spot up  though  I got a lotta more  I won t put the sugar coating on it though   Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy s expired  Rap s got you drained  dead tired  zapped  You feel like a wet pile of crap  But look  man  like the feds buggin  my phone  uh huh  I get why you re tapped  But you gotta get your fire back  Catch fire  get upset and fire back  Is what I tell myself  When times get bad   Cause sometimes I might get sad  But I take the same advice I had  And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie  when life s a drag  Told her to do like her dad  don t cry  get mad   Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags  I m hyper  by the time you see this side of me  I m right in your ass  Foot up it  I stood up for the kid who had to put up with the bullies at his school (at his school)  You ain t have to have no money or go shoppin  just to cop a fuckin  attitude  Now my dough s amountin  to a mountain  it s rised too high to count it  Never asked to be rich  all I did was wish I had a dime for every time that I was doubted  But then I think about it and I m enraged   Cause I just figured out that if I was paid  For the time I spent to put the pen to the page  It d be minimum wage  But it s embedded in my head  I never hunted for the bread  And what I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of  But I m never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood I put up in the pen  And when I m dead I wonder will they put me on a pedestal  Or forget I was ever this incredible  I guess I better go harder than ever  cause I ll never get  Another mothafuckin  opportunity again  To offend as many people with this I can  simply  Because  I can     Cause nobody likes me  everybody hates me  They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)  And drag my name through the mud  through the dirt  But I ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)  You can try to hold me down  but you better let me up   Cause you re only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)   Cause I pray when I get up I m never gonna let up   Til everybody eats my turds,Eminem

48,Hands up  officer don’t shoot  Then pull your pants up  promise you won t loot  We may never understand each other  it’s no use  We ain’t ever gonna grasp what each other goes through    Black boy  black boy  we ain t gonna lie to you  Black boy  black boy  we don t like the sight of you  Pull up on the side of you  Window rolled down   profile   Then we wonder why we see this side of you  Probably comin  from the dope house  We could let you slide but your tail light is blew  out  We know you re hidin  that Heidi Klum  On you another drug charge  homie  it s back inside for you  And just in case a chase might ensue  we got that tried and true  Pistol drew right at you  we d be delighted to unload it  In your back  then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you  Fucked up  but what the f ck am I to do   I keep tellin  myself  keep doin  like you re doin   No matter how many lives you ruin  It s for the red  white and blue  Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two  No one s ever indicted you  Why   Cause you re a    White boy  white boy  you re a rockstar  (My momma talkin  to me  tryna tell me how to live)  White boy  white boy  in your cop car  (But I don t listen to her   cause my head is like a sieve)  White boy  white boy  you re untouchable  (The world s coming to an end  I don t even care)  Nobody can tell me shit  cause I m a (big rockstar)    Black boy  black boy  we don t get your culture and  We don t care what our government s done to f ck you over  man  Don t tell us your attitude s a result of that  Balderdash  where’d you get the chip on your shoulder at   Why you kicking that soda can   Pull your pants up  we  bout to roll up and  Throw your ass in the van cuffed  You don t have to know our plans or what our intentions are  Our cards are close to our chest  you better show your hands  And put our minds more at ease  Or get shot in the thyroid  comply or die  boy  We re fightin  a crime war  here come the swine  Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities  That s what we call  em pigsties for  They re like eyesores to police  Talk to you like just a piece of trash  Feels like we re stuck in a time warp to me  As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions  As this beat backspins  it s like we re drifting back in  To the sixties  having black skin is risky   Cause this keeps happening  Throughout history  African Americans have been treated like shit  And I admit  there have been times where it s been embarrassin  to be a    White boy  white boy  you re a rockstar  (My momma talkin  to me  tryna tell me how to live)  White boy  white boy  in your cop car  (But I don t listen to her   cause my head is like a sieve)  White boy  white boy  you re untouchable  (The world s coming to an end  I don t even care)  Nobody can tell me shit  cause I m a (big rockstar)    Seems like the average lifespan of a white man  Is more than twice than a black life span  I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner  I feel like checking out on life  can t escape this circumstance  I d rather hear  em say  Die N word  than Die Antwoord  Ninja  now it s better disguised banter  But that s life  strapped  cause we re strapped financially  And can t find answers  We re applying  but McDonald s  Seems to be the only franchise that ll hire  So how can we have higher standards   As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter  We fight back with violence but acts like that are  Black eyes on the movement  Which makes black lives madder  At cops and cops madder  That s why it s at a stalemate  Can t arrive at a compromise so it s Black Ops  I wonder if we hire more black cops  the crap stops  The block is our backyards  officers  not the crack spot  Call the attack dogs off of us  man  You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop  And bad cops f ck it up for the good cops  and man  stop  Sendin  white cops in the black neighborhoods  Who ain t acclimated to  em  like that s the way to do it  Who seen some fuckin  videos of rappers waving guns  And know nobody black so they act afraid of us  And that s racism  the fear that a black face gives  em  A subconscious racist  Wait  why are there black neighborhoods    Cause America segregated us  designated us to an area  Separated us  Section Eight d us  When we tear it up’s the only time attention’s paid to us  And education sucks  and every day s another  Freddie Gray for us  a levy breaks or fuzz  Why is it they treat us like dryer lint   We just want a safe environment for our kids  But can’t escape the sirens  Don’t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in  The poverty that we face so the crime rate’s the highest in  The lowest classes  it s like a razor wire fence  And we’re trapped in these racial biases  That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise  Every time we see a devil’s face  Lions  tigers  and bears  oh my  It s more like billy clubs and gats  And we really love it when you think we’re guilty ‘cause we’re black   But you kill each other  facts  You peel each other s caps  for silly stuff like hats”  Single mother strugglin’ through substance abuse  While people with nothin  to lose shoot each other for shoes  F ck your Republican views  Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps  where the f ck are the boots   And streets act as a narrator  don t gotta read comics  Or be that into characters  just to see that  just to be black  You better be strapped with a derringer  Or be “capped in America” like Steve Rogers   Cause no one oversees these cops and  All we see is  em beat charges  We done seen  em beat Rodney King unconscious  and got off  So we don t need all you crooked police officers  peace offerings  Just keep marchin    til we reach congress  But they re gonna say you re tryin  to take an irrational stance  If you try to slander the flag but  Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb  So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum  If you don t stand for the national anthem  We raise it  you better praise it  Or you ll be made to feel like a traitor  we ll  Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield  Home of the brave is still racist  ville  So this whole nation feels like a plantation field  In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals  That had its Natives killed  Got you singin

52,On the first page of our story  The future seemed so bright  Then this thing turned out so evil  I don t know why I m still surprised  Even angels have their wicked schemes  And you take that to new extremes  But you ll always be my hero  Even though you ve lost your mind    Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  But that s all right because I like the way it hurts  Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  But that s all right because I love the way you lie  I love the way you lie  Oh  I love the way you lie    Now there s gravel in our voices  Glass is shattered from the fight  In this tug of war  you ll always win  Even when I m right   Cause you feed me fables from your head  With violent words and empty threats  And it s sick that all these battles  Are what keeps me satisfied    Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  But that s all right because I like the way it hurts  Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  But that s all right because I love the way you lie  I love the way you lie  Oh  I love the way you lie    So maybe I m a masochist  I try to run but I don t want to ever leave   Til the walls are goin  up  In smoke with all our memories    This morning  you wake  a sun ray hits your face  Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction  Hush baby  speak softly  tell me how awfully sorry  That you pushed me into the coffee table last night  So I can push you off me  Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me  Run out the room and I ll follow you like a lost puppy  Baby  without you  I m nothing  I m so lost  hug me  Then tell me how ugly I am  but that you ll always love me  Then after that  shove me  in the aftermath of the  Destructive path that we re on  two psychopaths but we  Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other s backs  That we ll have each others backs   cause we re that lucky  Together  we move mountains  let s not make mountains out of molehills   You hit me twice  yeah  but who s counting   I may have hit you three times  I m startin  to lose count  But together  we ll live forever  we found the youth fountain  Our love is crazy  we re nuts  but I refused counseling  This house is too huge  if you move out I ll burn all two thousand  Square feet of it to the ground  ain t shit you can do about it  With you I m in my fuckin  mind  without you  I m out it    Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  But that s all right because I like the way it hurts  Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  But that s all right because I love the way you lie  I love the way you lie  I love the way you lie  I love the way you lie  I love the way you lie,Eminem

54,Jumped out of the second floor of a record store  With a Treacherous Four cassette and a cassette recorder  In Ecuador with Edward Norton  Witness the metamorphosis of a legend growin  like an expert swordsman  From the Hessian war and hence the origin of the headless horseman  Born with the endorphin s of a pathetic orphan  Endless sores and reservoir of extension cords in dresser drawers  And deadbolts on the bedroom doors  And sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin  Excellent boyfriend    Use intercourse to settle scores with women who have been vendettas towards men  Dickhead is forced in to the shredded foreskin  Red is torn and they re only bein  fed a portion  Bed sores in sore shins  Pregnant whores can get abortions  Fetish for stickin  metal forks in  Self absorption  Skeletor  I went to hell and fell a floor  A predator  I m headed for competitors  Better warn  em  what I lack in tact and a set of morals  I make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store  Stegosaurus  Chuck Norris with a thesaurus  Yes of course  I mess up once  You want some  Come and get some  boys  I m givin  Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course  On excessive force and pressure points  And dressin  George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange  Dress and four inch heels to address the court  With a bullseye on his back  His whole chest and torso  Are left on the doorsteps of Trayvon s dad as a present for him  In my present form I m desert storm  Appetite for destruction is no suppressant for  Aggressive  forceful  and less remorseful in every morsel  Unpleasant  horrible  hello gorgeous  The rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus  Met a contortionist  said   When you wanna get sexual    She said   However I fit in your schedule  I m flexible   Expired tags on the Saturn  Got Kathryn Beck in the back in Daisy Dukes with the hazards on  At a traffic stop gettin  harassed  sign an autograph  For this asshole cop s daughter  laugh  cause I called her a brat on it  He spat on it and brought it back lookin  half in shock  Had a heart attack and dropped dead  Started fallin  back with it and got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock    One ball and half a dick  Apple Watch  Crack for an axle  walked in a Bass Pro Shop with David Hasselhoff  Pulled Tabasco sauce out of my satchel  Knocked over a fisherman s tackle box and  Asked if they had a laugh in stock  That was fuckin  stupid       You got it twisted  All  cause I offered this bitch a doggie biscuit you call me misogynistic  Bitch get to massagin  this dick  Like spas in this bitch  Slob on it with gobs of lipstick  Got a shoppin  list for you to run some odds and ends with  It s not a bitch on this earth I can be monogamous with  She s non existent  Robin Thicke with a throbbin  dick on some swab and slick shit  But I shout derogatives at bitches like fuckin  missile launches  Misfit  blond and nitwit like I ve gone ballistic  With a frostin  tip kit  Screamed   I hate blondes   and became one  I m optimistic  Love to start shit  Shovin  Clark Kent s undergarments in the glove compartment  Of the bucket  bumpin  Bubba Sparxxx  I m double parkin  up at Targets  Trouble  cause a double cross  The shadiest mothafucka you ll ever come across  Olympic gymnast  been known for some assaults  A couple lawsuits  enough to  cause a stomach ulcer  Same damn brain scan results  As Rainman s is  Something s awful when Dustin Hoffman s  Dressin  up in your mummy costume  On stage dancin  to  Brain Damage   What s the problem   Nothing s wrong  the name brand is back to reclaim status  Run the faucet  I m about to dunk a bunch of Trump supporters underwater  Snuck up on  em in Ray Bans in a gray van with a spray tan  It s a wrap like an Ace bandage  Don t give a f ck persona  To my last DNA strand  E&J in the waistband  At the VMAs with the stagehand  She wants kielbasa  Pre arrange an escape plan  Three inch blade on point like a Sensei  Consider me a dangerous man but you should be afraid of this dang candidate  You say Trump don t kiss ass like a puppet   Cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin   And that s what you wanted  A fuckin  loose cannon who s blunt with his hand on the button  Who doesn t have to answer to no one    Great idea     If I was president  Gettin  off is the first order of business  Once I get in office  Second thing that ll make me happy s walkin  up to Uncle Sam  Naked  laughing  dick cupped in hand  Screamin    F ck safe sex   throw a latex and an AIDS test at him  Tell Congress I run this land  And I want the rubber banned  And make it snappy  Addiction to friction and static  Addict who can t escape the habit  It s in you to chase the dragon  But as fate would have it  I walked up in major Magics  Dressed as the maintenance man  In a laser tag vest and a racin  jacket  With a gauge to blast it  And sped away in the station wagon  Stacey Dash s and Casey Anthony s crazy asses in the backseat  Throwin  Stay Free pads at me  Dead passenger in the passenger seat  Unfasten the safety latches  And slam on the brakes in traffic so hard  I snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires  Finna get a murder case and catch it  Like you threw it at me encased in plastic    And send Dylan Roof through the windshield of the Benz  Until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin      Like a windmill with a thin bill while his skin s peelin   And skids  til he hits a cement pillar  Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder  Knock it into the upper peninsula  You want to go against zilla  The Rap God  When will I quit  Never been realer  The in stiller of fear  not even a scintilla of doubt  Whose pens iller than Prince in a chinchilla  Or Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller  Revenge killer of bin syllable binge  Fill a syringe   till I  Draw first blood  Even pop shit on my pop shit  and it s popular  Couldn t be more awkwarder   Cause you re innocence I robbed you of  It s my fingers that got stuck up  Tortured a  not give a  Slapstick  hockey puck  The board hunter with the sawed off  Like an arm when it s lopped off  But I m not gonna  get the shotgun  Or the Glock  I m gonna opt for the ox   Cause I m into objects that are sharp when I sharpen  It s not a shock  I m such an obnoxious fucker  The rock cuts into rock  cause who would have thought  This much of a cocksucker that go across the buttocks of Vivica Fox with a box cutter  That was for 50  little slap on the wrist be warned  I m unravelling quickly  My squabbles  I m grappling with your time traveling with me  Try and follow  as I wobble  relapse into history  with a flask of the whiskey  Tip it back then I m twisting wine bottles  Like what happened to Chris Reeves spine column  That s the plan of attack when I m fixing my problems  Wish my chest wasn t having to get these rhymes off  em  But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles  And why I had to come back on these faggots who diss me  More of a spectacular mystery than a fucking Agatha Christie crime novel  But my patience is wearing thin  Swear I been contemplating rubbing shit in your face  till I smear it in  Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen  And never appear again   If you actually had fucking careers to end  But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer  em in that direction and forget my ideas for them  Molly I m gone off you  Man light some kush  You re my first take  I ll nail you  Can t lie  I gush  If I won you over  you would be the grand prize  I m entranced by your looks  come and give the Shady franchise a push  You can get it in a can like some Anheuser Busch  Jeans too small  least three pant sizes tush  Mushed against your damn side  you puss  And thighs are squooshed  What kind of attires that   I m ready to be rode  Psychopath  bet you we ll get it popping like a flat  Light the match to ignite the wrath

only six years old  We waited in the blistering cold for you  For four hours and you just said   No   That s pretty shitty  man  you re like his fuckin  idol  He wants to be just like you  man  he likes you more than I do  I ain t that mad though  I just don t like bein  lied to  Remember when we met in Denver  you said if I d write you you would write back  See  I m just like you in a way  I never knew my father neither  He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her  I can relate to what you re saying in your songs  So when I have a shitty day  I drift away and put  em on   Cause I don t really got shit else so that shit helps when I m depressed  I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest  Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds  It s like adrenaline  the pain is such a sudden rush for me  See everything you say is real  and I respect you  cause you tell it  My girlfriend s jealous  cause I talk  bout you 24/7  But she don t know you like I know you  Slim  no

me  that it s not so bad  It s not so bad    Dear Mister  I m Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans   This will be the last package I ever send your ass  It s been six months and still no word  I don t deserve it   I know you got my last two letters  I wrote the addresses on  em perfect  So this is my cassette I m sending you  I hope you hear it  I m in the car right now  I m doing ninety on the freeway  Hey Slim  I drank a fifth of vodka  You dare me to drive   You know the song by Phil Collins   In the Air of the Night   About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning  But didn

was a lousy letter or a call  I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall  I love you  Slim  we coulda been together  think about it  You ruined it now  I hope you can t sleep and you dream about it  And when you dream I hope you can t sleep and you scream about it  I hope your conscience eats at you and you can t breathe without me  See  Slim (shut up bitch  I m tryin  to talk )  Hey  Slim  that s my girlfriend screamin  in the trunk  But I didn t slit her throat  I just tied her up  see I ain t like you   Cause if she suffocates she ll suffer more  and then she ll die too  Well  gotta go  I m almost at the bridge now  Oh shit  I forgot  how am I supposed to send this shit out     My tea s gone cold  I m wondering why I  Got out of bed at all  The morning rain clouds up

the Starter cap  I m sorry I didn t see you at the show  I must ve missed you  Don t think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you  But what s this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists  too   I say that shit just clownin   dog  come on  how fucked up is you   You got some issues  Stan  I think you need some counseling  To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some  And what s this shit about us meant to be together   That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other  I really think you and your girlfriend need each other  Or maybe you just need to treat her better  I hope you get to read this letter  I just hope it reaches you in time  Before you hurt yourself  I think that you ll be doin  just fine  If you relax a little  I m glad I inspire you  but  Stan  Why are you so mad  Try to understand  that I do want you as a fan  I just don t want you to do some crazy shit  I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick  Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge  And had his girlfriend in the trunk  and she was pregnant with his kid  And in the car they found a tape  but they didn t say who it was

Pinching nurse s asses when I m jacking off with Jergens  And I m jerking  but this whole bag of Viagra isn t working  And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking  He could be working at Burger

116, Cause sometimes you just feel tired  you feel weak  And when you feel weak you feel like you want to just give up    But you gotta search within you  you gotta find that inner strength  And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up  And not be a quitter  no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse     Til I collapse I m spilling these raps long as you feel  em   Til the day that I drop you ll never say that I m not killing  em   Cause when I am not then I m a stop pinning them  And I am not hip hop and I m just not Eminem  Subliminal thoughts when I m stop sending them  Women are caught in webs spin and hock venom  Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin  to stop  Amoxicillin is just not real enough  The criminal cop killing hip hop filling a  Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners  You re coming with me  feel it or not  You re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us  You hear it a lot  lyrics that shock  is it a miracle  Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up  For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up  You Bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a f ck     Til the roof comes off  till the lights go out   Til my legs give out  can t shut my mouth    Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps  I m a rip this shit till my bone collapse      Til the roof comes off  till the lights go out   Til my legs give out  can t shut my mouth    Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps  I m a rip this shit till my bone collapse     Music is like magic there s a certain feeling you get  When you re real and you spit and people are feeling your shit  This is your moment and every single minute you spittin   Trying to hold onto it  cause you may never get it again  So while you re in it try to get as much shit as you can  And when your run is over just admit when it s at its end   Cause I m at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in  I got a list  here s the order of my list that it s in;  It goes  Reggie  Jay Z  Tupac and Biggie  Andre from Outkast  Jada  Kurupt  Nas and then me  But in this industry I m the cause of a lot of envy  So when I m not put on this list the shit does not offend me  That s why you see me walk around like nothing s bothering me  Even though half you people got a fuckin  problem with me  You hate it but you know respect you ve got to give me  The press s wet dream like Bobby and Whitney  Nate hit me     Til the roof comes off  till the lights go out   Til my legs give out  can t shut my mouth    Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps  I m a rip this shit till my bone collapse      Til the roof comes off  till the lights go out   Til my legs give out  can t shut my mouth    Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps  I m a rip this shit till my bone collapse     Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC s heart  What is he thinking  Enough to not go against me  smart  And its absurd how people hang on every word  I ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve  But I ll never be served my spot is forever reserved  If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first   Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse  That s why I m clever when I put together every verse  My thoughts are sporadic  I act like I m an addict  I rap like I m addicted to smack like I m Kim Mathers  But I don t want to go forth and back in constant battles  The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers   So this is like a full blown attack I m launching at  em  The track is on some battling raps who want some static   Cause I don t really think that the fact that I m Slim matters  A plaque of platinum status is whack if I m not the baddest     Til the roof comes off  till the lights go out   Til my legs give out  can t shut my mouth    Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps  I m a rip this shit till my bone collapse      Til the roof comes off  till the lights go out   Til my legs give out  can t shut my mouth    Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps  I m a rip this shit till my bone collapse     Until the roof (Until the roof)  The roof comes off (The roof comes off)  Until my legs (Until my legs)  Give out from underneath me (Underneath me  I)    I will not fall  I will stand tall  Feels like no one can beat me,Eminem

for me to just stand up and travel new land  Time for me to just take matters into my own hands  Once I m over these tracks  man I ma never look back  And I m gone  I know right where I m going  Sorry  momma  I m grown  I must travel alone  Ain t gon  follow no footsteps I m making my own  Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road    Walking these train tracks  Tryin  to regain back  The spirit I had  fore I go back to the same crap  To the same plant  And the same pants  Tryin  to chase rap  Gotta move ASAP  Get a new plan  Momma s got a new man  Poor little baby sister  she don t understand  Sits in front of the TV buries her nose in her pad  And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand  While she colors her big brother  her mother and dad  Ain t no telling what really goes on in her little head  Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had  But I keep running from something I never wanted so bad  Sometimes I get upset  cause I ain t blew up yet  It s like a grew up but I ain t grow me two nuts yet  Don t got a rep  my step  Don t got enough pep  The pressure s too much  man I m just tryin  to do what s best  And I try  Sit alone and I cry  Yo I won t tell no lie  Not a moment goes by  That I don t pray to the sky  Please  I m beggin  you God  Please don t let me be pigeon holed in no regular job  Yo I hope you can hear me homie wherever you are  Yo  I m telling you dog I m bailing this trailer tomorrow  Tell my mother I love her  kiss baby sister goodbye  Say whenever you need me  baby  I m never too far  But yo I gotta get out there the only way I know  And I ma be back for you the second that I blow  On everything I own  I ll make it on my own  Off to work I go  Back to this 8 Mile Road    I m a man  Gotta make a new plan  Time for me to just stand up and travel new land  Time for me to just take matters into my own hands  Once I m over these tracks  man I ma never look back  And I m gone  I know right where I m going  Sorry  momma  I m grown  I must travel alone  Ain t gon  follow no footsteps I m making my own  Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road    You gotta live it to feel it  You didn t  you wouldn t get it  Or see what the big deal is  Why it was and it still is  To be walking this borderline of Detroit s city limits  It s different and it s a certain significance  A certificate of authenticity  You d never even see  But it s everything to me  It s my credibility  You d never seen  heard  smelled or met a real mc  Who s incredible or on the same pedestal as me  But yet still unsigned  Having a rough time  Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes  Go to work and serve MC s in the lunch line  When it comes crunch time  Where did my punch lines go   Who must I show   To bust my flow  Where must I go   Who must I know   Or am I just another crab in the bucket  Cause I ain t having to run with this little rabbits but f ck it  Maybe I need a new outlet  I m starting to doubt shit  I m feeling a little skeptical who I hang out with  I live like a bum  yo my clothes ain t about shit  At the Salvation Army trying to salvage an outfit  And it s cold  Trying to travel this road  Plus I feel like I m always stuck in this battling mode  My defenses are so up  The one thing I don t want  Is pity from no one  This city is no fun  There is no sun  And it s so dark  Sometimes I just feel like I m being pulled apart  From each one of my limbs  By each one of my friends  It s enough to just make me want to jump out of my skin  Sometimes I feel like a robot  Sometimes I just know not  What I m doing  I just blow  my head is a stove top  I just explode  the kettle gets so hot  Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don t got  But I ve learned  It s time for me to u turn  Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned  Ain t no fallin  on next time I ll meet a new girl  I can not only play stupid or be immature  I got every ingredient all I need is the courage  Like I already got the beat all I need is the words  Got the urge  Suddenly it s a surge  Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred  Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third  I am no longer scared now  I m free as a bird  Then I turn and cross over the median curb  Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur  I m Eight Mile Road    I m a man  Gotta make a new plan  Time for me to just stand up and travel new land  Time for me to just take matters into my own hands  Once I m over these tracks  man I ma never look back  And I m gone  I know right where I m going  Sorry  momma  I m grown  I must travel alone  Ain t gon  follow no footsteps I m making my own  Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road,Eminem

183,Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain An asshole  that role I think I succeeded fulfillin  But don t think I ever stopped To think that I was speaking to children Everything was happening so fast It was like I blinked  sold three million Then it all went blank  all I remember is feelin  ridiculous  Cause I was getting sick of this feelin  Like I am always under attack  man I could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin  Women dishin  but really thinking   If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls  Like this I would kill him   Guess I m a little bit of a hypocrite when I m rippin  shit But since when did this many people ever give a shit  What I had to say  It s just my opinion If it contradicts how I m livin   put a dick in your rear end That s why every time you mentioned a lyric I thanked you for it  for drawing more attention toward it  Cause it gave me an enormous platform I m flattered you thought I was that important But you can t ignore the fact that I fought for the respect And battled for it  mad awards  had GLAAD annoyed Atta boy  they told me to slow down  and I just zoned out Good luck tryin  to convince a blonde It s like telling Gwen Stefani that she sold out  Cause I was tryin  to leave  no doubt In anyone s mind one day I d go down in history Think they know now  because everybody knows  Everybody knows that you re just an asshole Everywhere that you go People wanna go home  everyone knows Everybody knows  so don t pretend to be nice There s no place you can hide You are just an asshole Everyone knows  everyone knows  Thanks for the support  asshole  Thanks for the support  asshole   Quit actin  salty  I was countin  on you to count me out Ask Asher Roth when he round about Dissed me to shout me out Thought I was history  but Goddamn  honky That compliment s like backhanding a donkey Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth Nah  I m off him But what the f ck is all this trash talkin  about  The fight was fixed  I m back and you can t stop me You knocked me down  I went down for the count I fell  but the fans caught me  and now You re gonna have to beat the fuckin  pants off me To take my belt  word to Pacquiao Momma said there ain t nothin  else to talk about Better go in that ring and knock  em out Or you better not come out It s poetry in motion Like Freddie Roach when he s quotin  Shakespeare So what if the insults are revoltin   Even Helen Keller knows life stinks You think it s a joke  til you re bullet riddled But you should give little shit what I think This whole world is a mess Gotta have a Goddamn vest on your chest And a Glock just to go watch Batman Who needs to test a testicles  Not that man Half of you don t got the guts and intestinal blockage Rest of you got lap bands Stuck to this motto before they put bath salts And all those water bottles in Colorado So get lost  Waldo  My soul s escapin  Through this asshole that is gapin  A black hole  and I m swallowin  this track whole Better pack toilet paper  but I m taking no crap  ho Here I go down the Bat Pole And I m changing back into that old maniac In fact there they go tryin  to dip out the back door  retreatin   Cause everybody knows  Everybody knows that you re just an asshole Everywhere that you go People wanna go home  everyone knows Everybody knows  so don t pretend to be nice There s no place you can hide You are just an asshole Everyone knows  everyone knows  Holy mackerel  I m the biggest jerk on the planet Earth I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull For thinkin  we had some magnetic pull Then screamed  ICP in this bitch  How do fuckin  magnets work    Cause you re attractive  but we ain t attractable Hate to be dramatical  but I m not romantical I m making up words you can understandable  it s tragical Thinkin  some magical shit s gonna happen  that ain t practical You crackin  a joke  it s laughable  Cause me and love s like a bad combination I keep them feelings locked in a vault So it s safe to say I m uncrackable My heart is truly guarded  full body armor Bitch  you just need a helmet  Cause if you think you re special  you re retarded Thinkin  you re one of a kind Like you got some platinum vagina You re a train wreck  I got a one track mind Shorty  you re fine  but you sort of remind me of a 49er  Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor Been tryna hunt me down like a dog  Cause you re on my ass but you can t get a cent  Cause all of my spare time is spent On my nose in this binder  so don t bother tryin  Only women that I love are my daughters But sometimes I rhyme And it sounds like I forget I m a father  and I push it farther So  Father  forgive me if I forget to draw the line It s apparent I shouldn t have been a parent I ll never grow up  so to hell with your parents And motherfuckin  Father Time  it ain t never gonna stop A pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime So even if I m half dead  I m half alive Poured my half empty glass in a cup So now my cup has runneth over And I m  bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin  coaster I m going back to what got me here  yeah  cocky And can t knock being rude off  so fear not  my dear And dry up your teardrops  I m here White America s mirror  so don t feel awkward or weird If you stare at me and see yourself  because you re one too Shouldn t be a shock  because everybody knows  Everybody knows that you re just an asshole Everywhere that you go People wanna go home  everyone knows Everybody knows  so don t pretend to be nice

186,Look  I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings  But I m only going to get this one chance  Something s wrong  I can feel it (Six minutes  Slim Shady  you re on)  Just a feeling I ve got  like something s about to happen  but I don t know what  If that means  what I think it means  we re in trouble  big trouble   And if he is as bananas as you say  I m not taking any chances  You were just what the doctor ordered    I m beginning to feel like a Rap God  Rap God  All my people from the front to the back nod  back nod  Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box  slap box   They said I rap like a robot  so call me Rapbot    But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes  I got a laptop in my back pocket  My pen ll go off when I half cock it  Got a fat knot from that rap profit  Made a living and a killing off it  Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office  With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut sack  I m an MC still as honest  But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables  killaholic (Kill  em all with)  This slickety  gibbedy  hibbedy hip hop  You don t really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap  Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac  pack backpack rap  yep  yackidy yac  The exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I m practicing  That I ll still be able to break a motherfuckin  table  Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half  Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact  How could I not blow  All I do is drop F bombs  feel my wrath of attack  Rappers are having a rough time period  here s a Maxipad  It s actually disastrously bad  For the wack while I m masterfully constructing this masterpiece as    I m beginning to feel like a Rap God  Rap God  All my people from the front to the back nod  back nod  Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box  slap box   Let me show you maintaining this shit ain t that hard  that hard    Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got  Well  to be truthful the blueprint s simply rage and youthful exuberance  Everybody loves to root for a nuisance  Hit the earth like an asteroid  did nothing but shoot for the moon since  MC s get taken to school with this music   Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme  Now I lead a new school full of students  Me  I m a product of Rakim  Lakim Shabazz  2Pac N    W A  Cube  hey  Doc  Ren  Yella  Eazy  thank you  they got Slim  Inspired enough to one day grow up  blow up and be in a position  To meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherfuckin  Rock n   Roll Hall of Fame  Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames  Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame  On the wall of shame  You fags think it s all a game  til I walk a flock of flames  Off of planking  tell me what in the f ck are you thinking   Little gay looking boy  So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy  You witnessing a massacre  Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy  Oy vey  that boy s gay  that s all they say looking boy  You get a thumbs up  pat on the back  And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy  Hey  looking boy  what you say looking boy   I got a  hell yeah  from Dre looking boy  I mma work for everything I have  Never ask nobody for shit  get outta my face looking boy  Basically boy you re never gonna be capable  To keep up with the same pace looking boy     Cause I m beginning to feel like a Rap God  Rap God  All my people from the front to the back nod  back nod  The way I m racing around the track  call me Nascar  Nascar  Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park  the White Trash God  Kneel before General Zod this planet s Krypton  no Asgard  Asgard    So you be Thor and I ll be Odin  you rodent  I m omnipotent  Let off then I m reloading immediately with these bombs I m totin   And I should not be woken  I m the walking dead  but I m just a talking head  a zombie floating  But I got your mom deep throating  I m out my ramen noodle  we have nothing in common  poodle  I m a doberman  pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage  pupil  It s me  my honesty s brutal  But it s honestly futile if I don t utilize what I do though  For good at least once in a while  So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle  Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times  But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned  Rappers are hungry looking at me like it s lunchtime  I know there was a time where once I  Was king of the underground  but I still rap like I m on my Pharoahe Monch grind  So I crunch rhymes  but sometimes when you combine  Appeal with the skin color of mine  You get too big and here they come trying to   Censor you like that one line I said on  I m Back  from the Marshall Mathers LP  One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine  Put  em all in a line  add an AK 47  a revolver and a nine  See if I get away with it now that I ain t as big as I was  but I ve  Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal  You re stuck in a time warp from 2004 though  And I don t know what the f ck that you rhyme for  You re pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows  You re like normal  f ck being normal  And I just bought a new Raygun from the future  To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad   Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad  Singin  to a man while they played piano  Man  oh man  that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel  So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day   Hey  Fab  I mma kill you   Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed  (JJ Fad)  Uh  sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I m a human  What I gotta do to get it through to you I m superhuman  Innovative and I m made of rubber  So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it ll glue to you  I m never stating  more than never demonstrating  How to give a motherfuckin  audience a feeling like it s levitating  Never fading  and I know that the haters are forever waiting  For the day that they can say I fell off  they d be celebrating  Cause I know the way to get  em motivated  I make elevating music  you make elevator music  Oh  he s too mainstream  Well  that s what they do when they get jealous  they confuse it  It s not hip hop  it s pop  cause I found a hella way to fuse it  With rock  shock rap with Doc  Throw on Lose Yourself and make  em lose it  I don t know how to make songs like that  I don t know what words to use  Let me know when it occurs to you  While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you  It’s curtains  I’m inadvertently hurtin  you  How many verses I gotta murder to   Prove that if you re half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh   School flunkie  pill junky  But look at the accolades the skills brung me  Full of myself  but still hungry  I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to  And I m a million leagues above you  ill when I speak in tongues  But it s still tongue in cheek  f ck you  I m drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel  I m asleep in the front seat  Bumping Heavy D and the Boys  still chunky  but funky  But in my head there s something I can feel tugging and struggling  Angels fight with devils  here s what they want from me  They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate  But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had  Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation  And understand the discrimination  But f ck it  life s handing you lemons  make lemonade then  But if I can t batter the women how the f ck am I supposed to bake them a cake then   Don t mistake it for Satan  It s a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas  And take a vacation to trip a broad  And make her fall on her face and don t be a retard  Be a king  Think not  why be a king when you can be a,Eminem

191,I m liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought  I disgust you like dialogue from The Shop to The Wired Frog  Night club  shit  I was taught if your CD s on fire  You had to put it out yourself like Highland Park  no fire department  So you might not hear sirens at all  But don t be alarmed if I sound off  Something just ain t right with me  dawg  A martyr on a private charter  whose life could be harder   Widely regarded highly  bite me  sweetheart  I m slightly retarded  But tonight I m starting shit  I m feeling self righteous  I might just hop in a mosh pit on some Mike Tyson and Pac shit  Looking to box with anybody  disorderly conduct  I ll f ck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith  Fan of the LOX  bananas  manic  I m going in shock  Frantic  I m trapped in a closet  Panic attack cause I m claustrophobic  No  faggot  I mean I can t maneuver from movement   Cause I have no room for improvement  I m practically squashed  unpacked it and boxed it  Toxic  hands are arsenic  flammable bars  examine the content  Bar exam  start of insanity  Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson  Animal snarls  cannibal jaws  Shark mandibles  lambs to the slaughter  Looking scamp as Hannibal stalking  Anthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets  Black out  Zach Galifianakis  gallons of Vodka  But that gal has some knockers  I bet you they ring a bell when I come back and I m conscious  What happened  doc  I passed out again  Alcohol s making me break into vacant s naked  Stole a Magnum box and bag Cirocs in back of a Datsun  Fell asleep watching Fear Factor and Scare Tactics  Too close to the StairMaster  Poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it  Woke up shortly thereafter  hungover  No underwear  grasping a Bayer Aspirin and dropped it  Air Max in my closet  preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich  And the cross stitching is a cross mixing  Of a rhinoceros  possum skin  giraffe and a dolphin  Fin Dockers  OshKoshes  drop crotches  Swatch watches and sneakers matches with the Parkers  But it s like being overstaffed at a boxing gym  With all these trainers  but I don t have any boxers  And I m standing here naked  hangover  still wasted  Like paper you write raps on  obnoxious  Yo  why does it always sound like I m grabbing my nostrils   F ck that  I ll battle  em all  I ll battle a mall  I’ll stand there and yell that at a wall  Until the mannequin doll scatter and the inanimate objects  That I m battering all shatter and fall   Cause I hear the track and I m starting to get fucking amped  I mma spark plug  I m like the car with the cables hooked to my fucking back  I m a Duracell  But I sure as hell got it backwards cause y all could get jumped  And I d catch the battery charge  but  I got a hunch like your back when it s arching  When I start attacking your squadron  You ll feel like MasterCard when I m charging  So take a swipe at me  I m coming straight at you  Like Clay Matthews from the Green Bay Packers  So get the sack of Wisconsin  That s nutbag that I m talking  who am I kidding   You faggots are all gonna do my bidding  Don t get dragged to the auction  Neiman Marcus  bags of Vuitton and all  I ll push a bitch into oncoming traffic  just watch this  Stretched  tinted  black sedan my ass  See how mad you act when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave  In a fucking taxi cab to go shopping  Affable guy next door is laughable  My next whore s gonna have mechanical arms  That ll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor  No emotion hence I guess this sick prick dies hard  I got a Magic Johnson  It s like a Magic Wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me  If Ronda Rousey was on the couch with the condoms out  Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me  I ll laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me  Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around  And all I see is Paulie Malign now  she s slaughterhouse in a blouse  And Madonna with mud on her  God dammit I am misogynist  I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster  throw her off a balcony  Just so happens she s fond of algae   Cause now she s faceplants on the concrete  Complete lack of responsibility  Half you assholes ain t strong enough to pick up a spirit  Shit  you fags couldn t shoplift at a thrift shop  But I let the track lift  em up  boost the energy  Klepto  I m back to rip shop up  but my thing is this now  Five finger discount  Been rapping so long I ve been killing this shit  it s easy  Kidnapping your mom cause I m still in this bitch  thievery  Ransom for JonBenét Ramsey  Chandra Levy  and Gary Condit  ( Em ) Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde  I might relapse  get on some bullshit  Perhaps I ll launch some cracker taunts at Action Bronson  Macklemore  Mac Miller and Asher Roth  And have some back and forths  And record a wack response to Kendrick Lamar s  Control  verse  And perform  Fack  in concert    Yo  I put that shit on a greatest hits album  Now that was awesome  It takes some massive balls to do some shit like that  Sometimes I have to ponder why people are like  (I ll stick around)  And put up with my crap so long for  What s the attraction  mama   Is it the fact that I m a walking  talking  actual quadruple entendre  Or the pointy nose that s pointing at you  mama   Who knows at this point  it s always poking so meh  Still get along with this voice cause that s the monster  So do si do with a sociopath  everyone who knows me knows that  What they don t know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio  meh  She loves the way I lie  Sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow  Pathological liar  oh  why am I such an asshole  That my disguise is pants  but they on fire  So am I a  wooh  Cappadonna  cut the track off  Sabotage Christmas  crap in your stocking  I m wrapping up all the presents  In fucking camouflage so you can t even find  em  Jack Santa Claus  snap Rudolph s antlers off  Wrap his schnoz in gauze bandage and blind him  Blowing the head gasket at Bed  Bath and Beyond  Put the basket back while the bath salt packets are gone  I  Know you really tired of me sampling Billy Squier  But classic rock acid rap is the genre  Got Slash on guitar  splashing Bizarre  Thrasher and Aerosmith  And I m a spectacular archer  feed count Dracula Chocula  Godzilla  half dragon and Bob Dylan  Bandwagoners  I m kicking the damn stragglers off and I m strangling  em  Smack Kim Basinger on a ass,Eminem
192,I guess you could consider it poetry But with me it started out with just words just words They started looking like puzzle pieces so I started Connecting them to each other  til they started to resemble blank canvases By this time I was an artist so I just started to see these pictures  these real visuals I m a psychopath  I m a killer  (I m a psychopath  I m a killer I m a psychopath  I m a killer A psychopath  I m a killer A psychopath  I m a killer)  Feelin  it in the air  breathe it in the night Sayin  I m a killer Did you ever think we would come to find  Maybe in my dreams  I m a

ass With a toilet in front of him  throwin  up  pissed off Prolly symbolic of this thought  sick tot To my inner enemy in a rush I m havin  nightmares of leavin  behind my dreams With anything less than a full bank It s like I m General Hong  and I m standin  in front of a gun I m puttin  myself in the way of a bullet to pull rank The hood is over my eyes but the wool ain t Yeah  got the mentality of bein  with a wizard Every award show  we don t even get considered How do you sell somethin  that s so lyrical To a kid that wouldn t know what was hittin  if it hit him  Now I wanna talk about these niggas from Detroit Beef on me and Shady who was thinkin   bout Detroit We put the world onto it so watch how you say  f ck me  You just might jinx yourself  whoop  your girl gon  do it

set your daughter on fire with a soldering iron What up mom  applyin  for the rim job  are you hirin   I m hopin  to fill up your opening Oh but I know I gotta meet a lot of requirements First I gotta accept you in the lobby and the isle and You ve probably already been with all the slaughter and I am in No mood to be playin  second fiddle  slob on this violin With no strings attached I m just the product of a hostile environment But bein  brought up so brought up inspired But I don t know why  it s still like I m caught up inside a whirlpool Not an appliance  but applyin  this science  I psychotically rhyme And it s like stars have aligned all in alliance Heart of a lion  balls of Goliath Obscene talkin   the twine like a bean s talkin  and buyin  But I keep walkin  the line between the wrong and the right But everything I write seems wrong and it s like I m ecstatic at all the static that I can still cause In the fabric of our modern society Now Catholics are panicking cause I snapped back to my old antics and shenanigans Dammit the pope s mad again Probably shouldn t have ran up in the Vatican with that mannequin Singin   Bagpipes from Baghdad  again In my dad s drag draggin  a faggot in  a glad bag Won t be the last time I make a dramatic entrance  like that again You thought I was lyin  when I said I think that I m crossin  the line again  I ve lost my mind  caution oh God I think I ve thought of another fucking line Forgive me father  for I have sinned But hip hop has left me brainwashed with a violent streak Defiant  now the odds of me tryin  to fuckin  be quiet Probably gotta be  bout as high as the Jolly Green Giant After he s fallen in pollen next to a killer bee hive colony tryin  to sneak by it So please don t follow me while I revive rap I ma start up a rioting  try to stop it or silence it You re not gonna  might as well just hit the block in your joggin  attire in Boston  across the marathon finish line and I Put your thoughts against mine Cause the arsenal I have ll scar you for life  worse than Dzhokhar s And I have a bomb  pliers and barbed wire Your bars are like Barney Fife with a fucking swiss army knife A saber that s Darth Vader with arthritis at a bar fight With the Dark Knight on a dark night with his arms tied up I m Dahmer like when I m on the mic  I m not gonna lie I perform like I m gonna die at the end of a song so it s hard for the rhyme to end Like f ck  em all I m just ridin Like I m locked up inside a shot of Bonnie and Clyde called Uncle Ronnie is driving   bout to burst in through the side door F ck up an asylum and park in the dining room  (I m a psychopath  I m a killer) You ain t ever see a mothafucka get realer (A psychopath  I m a killer) Goin  automatic on anybody sporadic I choose (A psychopath  I m a killer) Cause ain t nobody iller Knowing nobody for realer (A psychopath  I m a killer),Eminem

194,Feels like a close  it’s coming to F ck am I gonna do  It s too late to start over This is the only thing I  thing I know  Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is Find different ways to word the same  old song Ever since I came along From the day the song called ‘’Hi  My Name Is’’ dropped Started thinking my name was fault  Cause anytime things went wrong I was the one who they would blame it on The media made me the equivalent of a modern day Genghis Khan Tried to argue it was only entertainment  dawg Gangsta  Naw  courageous balls Had to change my style  they said I m way too soft And I sound like AZ and Nas  out came the claws And the fangs been out since then But up until the instant that I’ve been against it It was ingrained in me that I wouldn’t amount to a shitstain I thought No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught Do I really belong in this game  I pondered I just wanna play my part  should I make waves or not  So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on And I don’t wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon But sometimes you gotta take a loss And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off And keep pluggin’  it’s your only outlet And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it Better find a way to counter it quick and make it  ah Feel like I’ve already said this a kabillion eighty times How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme  What I really wanna say is  is there anyone else that can relate to my story  Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are  I was afraid to Make a single sound Afraid I will never find a way out  out  out Afraid I never before I didn’t wanna go another round An angry man s power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip toe love Run out of excuses with every word So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear  (The time is here) Guts over fear  (I shall not tear) For all the times I let you push me around And let you keep me down (Now I got) Guts over fear  guts over fear  Feels like a close  it’s coming to F ck am I gonna do  It s too late to start over This is the only thing I  thing I know  I know what it was like  I was there once  single parents Hate your appearance  did you struggle to find your place in this world  And the pain spawns all the anger on But it wasn’t until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on That I made a spark  started to spit hard as shit Learned how to harness it while the reins were off And there was a lot of bizarre shit  but the crazy part Was soon as I stopped saying  I gave a f ck  Haters started to appreciate my art And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I’ve caused But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone  And the lights go out in the trailer park  And the window that was closing and there’s nowhere else I can go with flows in And I’m frozen cause there’s no more emotion for me to pull from Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same  old song But I’d rather make “Not Afraid 2” than making another mothafuckin’ “We Made You” uh Now I don’t wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs My demise and my uprise  pray to God I just opened enough eyes later on Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong And enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt  Cause I can’t explain to y’all how dang exhausted my legs felt Just having to balance my damn self But on eggshells I was made to walk But thank you  ma  ‘cause that gave me the Strength to cause Shady mania  so many empty that stadium At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done So this is for every kid who all’s they ever did was dreamt that one day just getting accepted I represent him or her  anyone similar  you are the reason that I made this song Everything you re scared to say don t be afraid to say no more From this day on forward  just let them a holes talk Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I’m gone And to think I was gone  I was afraid to Make a single sound Afraid I will never find a way out  out  out Afraid I never before I didn’t wanna go another round An angry man s power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip toe love Run out of excuses with every word So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear  (The time is here) Guts over fear  (I shall not tear) For all the times I let you push me around And let you keep me down (Now I got) Guts over fear  guts over fear,Eminem

confusion Its all an illusion It s probably the shrooms I m on  Cause I think I started hallucinating  Cause I just thought I just heard Jay Electronica and Odd Future s new shit And all I can do is follow the music And end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza Fillin  water balloons with nail polish remover Just to pop  em and wallow in fumes I feel uptight I gotta get looser After I finish polishing off this bottle of booze I got a solution Concentrated like orange juice so I m not as diluted Cause all this delusion got me seein  shit Excusez moi but that coochie that passed You see her ass  Wouldn t make her my main squeeze But juicier ass  it belongs in a juicer It s mouth waterin  too so I walked up to it like I m Marshall Wanna try to meet my standards  I ll Introduce ya Oh I m a misogynist too but I m not a masseuse But my attitude is rubbin  off on the youth A chronic abuser  not only user of marijuana I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of you losers Got a bazooka  a shotgun  a ruger  a Glock  and a nuke And a Rottweiler too  I m not in the mood so When I say I m bringing the TEC out I m not coming to repair your fuckin  electronic computers God  I m gonna puke I m so gone off the hookah I think I swallowed a loofah I m tore up  demolished  a fuckin  stone like Oliver Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her The thoughts I produce are loony tunes The box of usable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes To replace next up Veronica s boobs And uhh  paycheck stubs that were stuffed in the glove box In a blue Honda with used condoms were clues The girl was just not the one suitable for or  Right for me  will change me  rearrange my head to be Just right for you and me  don’t laugh  please listen Don’t laugh  please listen  Thought I’d give in to the pressure Collapse and crumble perhaps Relapsing under that Well that s a bunch of crap In the clutch  I m the Captain Crunch of rap And I m sick of acting humble  that s enough of that F ck that shit  cut the sack Like its a natural reaction That s why I m actually trapped in this shoving match  Cause push keeps coming to that I can keep getting my ass kicked  I’m coming back Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit  still mad Disgruntled had some struggles yeah But that passionate hunger s back The fantastic juggling act And the way I flip my tongue on the track It s like verbal acrobatics But in fact Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic I fuckin  crashed my hovercraft After I strapped the duffel bag to my back And stuck the massive punchin  bag in it An elastic bungee strap  proper plaster  a thumb tack And a piece of plastic bubble wrap Went spastic and fuckin  snapped Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid Stumbled back  recovered  back flipped And landed on a gymnastic tumble mat And for my last trick  lunge on back lash On a NASA shuttle flap  fuckin  snapped the rudder in half Chuckled and laughed  buttaled my last rebuttal And just asked him to come crash And I grab my Go Go Gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress And ceramic construction hat Rubbed my magic mushroom tat Fell off then splat  get up from that Face taped to a waste paper basket Throw up then gas  lungs collapse And that s more likely than finding someone that s  Right for me  will change me  rearrange my head to be Just right for you and me  don’t laugh  please listen Don’t laugh  please listen  Couple of shots of Jäger Public intoxication  dis fuckin  combobulation Flooded with thoughts of anger While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin   You re top ten ain t cha   stop cause you fuckers are talkin  crazy And stop interrupting you re not even up in the conversation Whether you re punchin  a clock or famous Underground  pop  or nameless  whatever your job is I came to f ck with your occupation You re thinkin  just cause you came in with scrubs And you brought the scalpel and sponge The oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon Stuck in the operating room Once you done swapped your name with him Smuggled in Ronald Reagan Dug him up Donald Fagen While juggling waffles baking Fuckin  McDonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagle They flung it across the table Then bump it and knock it shake it Jumped and got in the way then disrupted my concentration I said f ck it and lost my patience Since they all woke up from sedation Ain t none of you Doctor Dre So then what does it got you thinkin  You can f ck with this operation Aftermath  still running hip hop amazing I m still pluggin  along No need for an assumption Here s confirmation I m up for the long duration I m just looking for something to walk away with Some pocket change and a little integrity Though I ll probably be jumpin  across the stage Till I m fuckin  Madonna s age and Stuck in an awkward place in my life But I shit you not like I m fucked up with constipation That day will come before I stumble upon some lady that’s  Right for me  will change me  rearrange my head to be Just right for you and me  don’t laugh  please listen Don’t laugh  please listen,Eminem

201,I guess you could consider it poetry But with me it started out with just words just words They started looking like puzzle pieces so I started Connecting them to each other  til they started to resemble blank canvases By this time I was an artist so I just started to see these pictures  these real visuals I m a psychopath  I m a killer  (I m a psychopath  I m a killer I m a psychopath  I m a killer A psychopath  I m a killer A psychopath  I m a killer)  Feelin  it in the air  breathe it in the night Sayin  I m a killer Did you ever think we would come to find  Maybe in my dreams  I m a psychopath  I m never keepin  it plain Lyrical murder is somethin  I ve been about Ever since I was a little kid  doodlin  in the class Drew a picture of my teacher  bullet in his head  ruler in his ass With a toilet in front of him  throwin  up  pissed off Prolly symbolic of this thought  sick tot To my inner enemy in a rush I m havin  nightmares of leavin  behind my dreams With anything less than a full bank It s like I m General Hong  and I m standin  in front of a gun I m puttin  myself in the way of a bullet to pull rank The hood is over my eyes but the wool ain t Yeah  got the mentality of bein  with a wizard Every award show  we don t even get considered How do you sell somethin  that s so lyrical To a kid that wouldn t know what was hittin  if it hit him  Now I wanna talk about these niggas from Detroit Beef on me and Shady who was thinkin   bout Detroit We put the world onto it so watch how you say  f ck me  You just might jinx yourself  whoop  your girl gon  do it Cause I was in that 911 in Chicago  911 at the same time I had already been grindin  since  97  that s longevity And if you think you re lyrically better  you better be a killer  (I m a psychopath  I m a killer) You ain t ever see a mothafucka get realer (A psychopath  I m a killer) Goin  automatic on anybody sporadic I choose (A psychopath  I m a killer) Cause ain t nobody iller Knowing nobody for realer (A psychopath  I m a killer)  It s an elite drinker  mister ringleader I m a deep thinker  I m a street preacher With a street sweeper full of heat seekers In your Jeep speakers I mma keep ringers I don t need heaters  I got the meat cleaver Welcome to the slaughterhouse Niggas try to tell me I spell too much Capital S to the laugh to the T E R Ho  U S E  now go to hell you fucks  word Making work disappear quick as magic Abracadabra  the trafficker blacker than Africa Can you imagine a nigga flipping bread for the blood  Money like Dracula  hand him some spatula  ask me a question Am I the best with the flexing  F ck yes with the goon talk I just moonwalk all over the beat then I m lightin  up the street Crooked going Michael Jackson on Thriller I m a psychopath  I m a killer  You ain t ever see a mothafucka get realer (A psychopath  I m a killer) Goin  automatic on anybody sporadic I choose (A psychopath  I m a killer) Cause ain t nobody iller Knowing nobody for realer (A psychopath  I m a killer)  Feelin  it in the air  breathe it in the night Sayin  I m a killer Did you ever think we would come to find  Maybe in my dreams  The thought of retiring Is makin  me want to set your daughter on fire with a soldering iron What up mom  applyin  for the rim job  are you hirin   I m hopin  to fill up your opening Oh but I know I gotta meet a lot of requirements First I gotta accept you in the lobby and the isle and You ve probably already been with all the slaughter and I am in No mood to be playin  second fiddle  slob on this violin With no strings attached I m just the product of a hostile environment But bein  brought up so brought up inspired But I don t know why  it s still like I m caught up inside a whirlpool Not an appliance  but applyin  this science  I psychotically rhyme And it s like stars have aligned all in alliance Heart of a lion  balls of Goliath Obscene talkin   the twine like a bean s talkin  and buyin  But I keep walkin  the line between the wrong and the right But everything I write seems wrong and it s like I m ecstatic at all the static that I can still cause In the fabric of our modern society Now Catholics are panicking cause I snapped back to my old antics and shenanigans Dammit the pope s mad again Probably shouldn t have ran up in the Vatican with that mannequin Singin   Bagpipes from Baghdad  again In my dad s drag draggin  a faggot in  a glad bag Won t be the last time I make a dramatic entrance  like that again You thought I was lyin  when I said I think that I m crossin  the line again  I ve lost my mind  caution oh God I think I ve thought of another fucking line Forgive me father  for I have sinned But hip hop has left me brainwashed with a violent streak Defiant  now the odds of me tryin  to fuckin  be quiet Probably gotta be  bout as high as the Jolly Green Giant After he s fallen in pollen next to a killer bee hive colony tryin  to sneak by it So please don t follow me while I revive rap I ma start up a rioting  try to stop it or silence it You re not gonna  might as well just hit the block in your joggin  attire in Boston  across the marathon finish line and I Put your thoughts against mine Cause the arsenal I have ll scar you for life  worse than Dzhokhar s And I have a bomb  pliers and barbed wire Your bars are like Barney Fife with a fucking swiss army knife A saber that s Darth Vader with arthritis at a bar fight With the Dark Knight on a dark night with his arms tied up I m Dahmer like when I m on the mic  I m not gonna lie I perform like I m gonna die at the end of a song so it s hard for the rhyme to end Like f ck  em all I m just ridin Like I m locked up inside a shot of Bonnie and Clyde called Uncle Ronnie is driving   bout to burst in through the side door F ck up an asylum and park in the dining room  (I m a psychopath  I m a killer) You ain t ever see a mothafucka get realer (A psychopath  I m a killer) Goin  automatic on anybody sporadic I choose (A

203,Feels like a close  it’s coming to F ck am I gonna do  It s too late to start over This is the only thing I  thing I know  Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is Find different ways to word the same  old song Ever since I came along From the day the song called ‘’Hi  My Name Is’’ dropped Started thinking my name was fault  Cause anytime things went wrong I was the one who they would blame it on The media made me the equivalent of a modern day Genghis Khan Tried to argue it was only entertainment  dawg Gangsta  Naw  courageous balls Had to change my style  they said I m way too soft And I sound like AZ and Nas  out came the claws And the fangs been out since then But up until the instant that I’ve been against it It was ingrained in me that I wouldn’t amount to a shitstain I thought No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught Do I really belong in this game  I pondered I just wanna play my part  should I make waves or not  So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on And I don’t wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon But sometimes you gotta take a loss And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off And keep pluggin’  it’s your only outlet And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it Better find a way to counter it quick and make it  ah Feel like I’ve already said this a kabillion eighty times How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme  What I really wanna say is  is there anyone else that can relate to my story  Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are  I was afraid to Make a single sound Afraid I will never find a way out  out  out Afraid I never before I didn’t wanna go another round An angry man s power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip toe love Run out of excuses with every word So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear  (The time is here) Guts over fear  (I shall not tear) For all the times I let you push me around And let you keep me down (Now I got) Guts over fear  guts over fear  Feels like a close  it’s coming to F ck am I gonna do  It s too late to start over This is the only thing I  thing I know  I know what it was like  I was there once  single parents Hate your appearance  did you struggle to find your place in this world  And the pain spawns all the anger on But it wasn’t until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on That I made a spark  started to spit hard as shit Learned how to harness it while the reins were off And there was a lot of bizarre shit  but the crazy part Was soon as I stopped saying  I gave a f ck  Haters started to appreciate my art And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I’ve caused But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone  And the lights go out in the trailer park  And the window that was closing and there’s nowhere else I can go with flows in And I’m frozen cause there’s no more emotion for me to pull from Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same  old song But I’d rather make “Not Afraid 2” than making another mothafuckin’ “We Made You” uh Now I don’t wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs My demise and my uprise  pray to God I just opened enough eyes later on Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong And enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt  Cause I can’t explain to y’all how dang exhausted my legs felt Just having to balance my damn self But on eggshells I was made to walk But thank you  ma  ‘cause that gave me the Strength to cause Shady mania  so many empty that stadium At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done So this is for every kid who all’s they ever did was dreamt that one day just getting accepted I represent him or her  anyone similar  you are the reason that I made this song Everything you re scared to say don t be afraid to say no more From this day on forward  just let them a holes talk Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I’m gone And to think I was gone  I was afraid to Make a single sound Afraid I will never find a way out  out  out Afraid I never before I didn’t wanna go another round An angry man s power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip toe love Run out of excuses with every word So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear  (The time is here) Guts over fear  (I shall not tear) For all the times I let you push me around And let you keep me down (Now I got) Guts over fear  guts over fear,Eminem

206,I feel phenomenal as usual Pharmaceuticals  glue stick to crucify me at Bonnaroo But I don t know if I m in Tennessee  Chicago  or Houston In the corner trying to seek solitude Shallow but such a hollow dude I won t even swallow solid food Alcoholic too  plus I m on lean like the Tower of Pisa Top it off I m on mushrooms so f ck all of you Roses are violet  mollies are blue Lost in a ball of confusion Its all an illusion It s probably the shrooms I m on  Cause I think I started hallucinating  Cause I just thought I just heard Jay Electronica and Odd Future s new shit And all I can do is follow the music And end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza Fillin  water balloons with nail polish remover Just to pop  em and wallow in fumes I feel uptight I gotta get looser After I finish polishing off this bottle of booze I got a solution Concentrated like orange juice so I m not as diluted Cause all this delusion got me seein  shit Excusez moi but that coochie that passed You see her ass  Wouldn t make her my main squeeze But juicier ass  it belongs in a juicer It s mouth waterin  too so I walked up to it like I m Marshall Wanna try to meet my standards  I ll Introduce ya Oh I m a misogynist too but I m not a masseuse But my attitude is rubbin  off on the youth A chronic abuser  not only user of marijuana I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of you losers Got a bazooka  a shotgun  a ruger  a Glock  and a nuke And a Rottweiler too  I m not in the mood so When I say I m bringing the TEC out I m not coming to repair your fuckin  electronic computers God  I m gonna puke I m so gone off the hookah I think I swallowed a loofah I m tore up  demolished  a fuckin  stone like Oliver Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her The thoughts I produce are loony tunes The box of usable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes To replace next up Veronica s boobs And uhh  paycheck stubs that were stuffed in the glove box In a blue Honda with used condoms were clues The girl was just not the one suitable for or  Right for me  will change me  rearrange my head to be Just right for you and me  don’t laugh  please listen Don’t laugh  please listen  Thought I’d give in to the pressure Collapse and crumble perhaps Relapsing under that Well that s a bunch of crap In the clutch  I m the Captain Crunch of rap And I m sick of acting humble  that s enough of that F ck that shit  cut the sack Like its a natural reaction That s why I m actually trapped in this shoving match  Cause push keeps coming to that I can keep getting my ass kicked  I’m coming back Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit  still mad Disgruntled had some struggles yeah But that passionate hunger s back The fantastic juggling act And the way I flip my tongue on the track It s like verbal acrobatics But in fact Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic I fuckin  crashed my hovercraft After I strapped the duffel bag to my back And stuck the massive punchin  bag in it An elastic bungee strap  proper plaster  a thumb tack And a piece of plastic bubble wrap Went spastic and fuckin  snapped Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid Stumbled back  recovered  back flipped And landed on a gymnastic tumble mat And for my last trick  lunge on back lash On a NASA shuttle flap  fuckin  snapped the rudder in half Chuckled and laughed  buttaled my last rebuttal And just asked him to come crash And I grab my Go Go Gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress And ceramic construction hat Rubbed my magic mushroom tat Fell off then splat  get up from that Face taped to a waste paper basket Throw up then gas  lungs collapse And that s more likely than finding someone that s  Right for me  will change me  rearrange my head to be Just right for you and me  don’t laugh  please listen Don’t laugh  please listen  Couple of shots of Jäger Public intoxication  dis fuckin  combobulation Flooded with thoughts of anger While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin   You re top ten ain t cha   stop cause you fuckers are talkin  crazy And stop interrupting you re not even up in the conversation Whether you re punchin  a clock or famous Underground  pop  or nameless  whatever your job is I came to f ck with your occupation You re thinkin  just cause you came in with scrubs And you brought the scalpel and sponge The oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon Stuck in the operating room Once you done swapped your name with him Smuggled in Ronald Reagan Dug him up Donald Fagen While juggling waffles baking Fuckin  McDonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagle They flung it across the table Then bump it and knock it shake it Jumped and got in the way then disrupted my concentration I said f ck it and lost my patience Since they all woke up from sedation Ain t none of you Doctor Dre So then what does it got you thinkin  You can f ck with this operation Aftermath  still running hip hop amazing I m still pluggin  along No need for an assumption Here s confirmation I m up for the long duration I m just looking for something to walk away with Some pocket change and a little integrity Though I ll probably be jumpin  across the stage Till I m fuckin  Madonna s age and Stuck in an awkward place in my life But I shit you not like I m fucked up with constipation That day will come before I stumble upon some lady that’s  Right for me  will change me  rearrange my head to be Just right for you and me  don’t laugh  please listen Don’t laugh  please listen,Eminem

used to use my mothafuckin  trailer to tease me with  But I flipped that script like AB filler  Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal  It made me feel amazing  made me celebrate me  And if I may reiterate  I ain t even need a script  I ain t bein  conceited  but I made it to radio  eat a dick  I still never ABC the shit  Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller  Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla  I was daydreamin  one day I would be the shit  And if I ever end up escapin  the streets I swear that I would stay here  Still in it  I m crazy  I ll always be real

yourself like Highland Park  no fire department So you might not hear sirens at all But don t be alarmed if I sound off Something just ain t right with me  dawg A martyr on a private charter  whose life could be harder  Widely regarded highly  bite me  sweetheart  I m slightly retarded But tonight I m starting shit  I m feeling self righteous I might just hop in a mosh pit on some Mike Tyson and Pac shit Looking to box with anybody  disorderly conduct I ll f ck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith Fan of the LOX  bananas  manic  I m going in shock Frantic  I m trapped in a closet Panic attack cause I m claustrophobic No  faggot  I mean I can t maneuver from movement Cause I have no room for improvement I m practically squashed  unpacked it and boxed it Toxic  hands are arsenic  flammable bars  examine the content Bar exam  start of insanity Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson Animal snarls  cannibal jaws Shark mandibles  lambs to the slaughter Looking scamp as Hannibal stalking Anthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets Black out  Zach Galifianakis  gallons of Vodka But that gal has some knockers I bet you they ring a bell when I come back and I m conscious What happened  doc  I passed out again Alcohol s making me break into vacant s naked Stole a Magnum box and bag Cirocs in back of a Datsun Fell asleep watching Fear Factor and Scare Tactics Too close to the StairMaster Poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it Woke up shortly thereafter  hungover No underwear  grasping a Bayer Aspirin and dropped it Air Max in my closet  preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich And the cross stitching is a cross mixing Of a rhinoceros  possum skin  giraffe and a dolphin Fin Dockers  OshKoshes  drop crotches Swatch watches and sneakers

not let a blonde arouse me If Ronda Rousey was on the couch with the condoms out Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me I ll laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around And all I see is Paulie Malign now  she s slaughterhouse in a blouse And Madonna with mud on her  God dammit I am misogynist I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster  throw her off a balcony Just so happens she s fond of algae Cause now she s faceplants on the concrete Complete lack of responsibility Half you assholes ain t strong enough to pick up a spirit Shit  you fags couldn t shoplift at a thrift shop But I let the track lift  em up  boost the energy Klepto  I m back to rip shop up  but my thing is this now Five finger discount Been rapping so long I ve been killing this shit  it s easy Kidnapping your mom cause I m still in this bitch  thievery Ransom for JonBenét Ramsey  Chandra Levy  and Gary Condit ( Em ) Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde I might relapse  get on some bullshit Perhaps I ll launch some cracker taunts at Action Bronson Macklemore  Mac Miller and Asher Roth And have some back and forths And record a wack response to Kendrick Lamar s  Control  verse And perform  Fack  in concert  Yo  I put that shit on a greatest hits album Now that was awesome It takes some massive balls to do some shit like that Sometimes I have to ponder why people are like (I ll stick around) And put up with my crap so long for What s the attraction  mama  Is it the fact that I m a walking  talking  actual quadruple

214,Feels like a close  it’s coming to F ck am I gonna do  It s too late to start over This is the only thing I  thing I know  Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is Find different ways to word the same  old song Ever since I came along From the day the song called ‘’Hi  My Name Is’’ dropped Started thinking my name was fault  Cause anytime things went wrong I was the one who they would blame it on The media made me the equivalent of a modern day Genghis Khan Tried to argue it was only entertainment  dawg Gangsta  Naw  courageous balls Had to change my style  they said I m way too soft And I sound like AZ and Nas  out came the claws And the fangs been out since then But up until the instant that I’ve been against it It was ingrained in me that I wouldn’t amount to a shitstain I thought No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught Do I really belong in this game  I pondered I just wanna play my part  should I make waves or not  So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on And I don’t wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon But sometimes you gotta take a loss And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off And keep pluggin’  it’s your only outlet And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it Better find a way to counter it quick and make it  ah Feel like I’ve already said this a kabillion eighty times How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme  What I really wanna say is  is there anyone else that can relate to my story  Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are  I was afraid to Make a single sound Afraid I will never find a way out  out  out Afraid I never before I didn’t wanna go another round An angry man s power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip toe love Run out of excuses with every word So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear  (The time is here) Guts over fear  (I shall not tear) For all the times I let you push me around And let you keep me down (Now I got) Guts over fear  guts over fear  Feels like a close  it’s coming to F ck am I gonna do  It s too late to start over This is the only thing I  thing I know  I know what it was like  I was there once  single parents Hate your appearance  did you struggle to find your place in this world  And the pain spawns all the anger on But it wasn’t until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on That I made a spark  started to spit hard as shit Learned how to harness it while the reins were off And there was a lot of bizarre shit  but the crazy part Was soon as I stopped saying  I gave a f ck  Haters started to appreciate my art And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I’ve caused But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone  And the lights go out in the trailer park  And the window that was closing and there’s nowhere else I can go with flows in And I’m frozen cause there’s no more emotion for me to pull from Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same  old song But I’d rather make “Not Afraid 2” than making another mothafuckin’ “We Made You” uh Now I don’t wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs My demise and my uprise  pray to God I just opened enough eyes later on Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong And enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt  Cause I can’t explain to y’all how dang exhausted my legs felt Just having to balance my damn self But on eggshells I was made to walk But thank you  ma  ‘cause that gave me the Strength to cause Shady mania  so many empty that stadium At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done So this is for every kid who all’s they ever did was dreamt that one day just getting accepted I represent him or her  anyone similar  you are the reason that I made this song Everything you re scared to say don t be afraid to say no more From this day on forward  just let them a holes talk Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I’m gone And to think I was gone  I was afraid to Make a single sound Afraid I will never find a way out  out  out Afraid I never before I didn’t wanna go another round An angry man s power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip toe love Run out of excuses with every word So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear  (The time is here) Guts over fear  (I shall not tear) For all the times I let you push me around And let you keep me down (Now I got) Guts over fear  guts over fear,Eminem

217,I feel phenomenal as usual Pharmaceuticals  glue stick to crucify me at Bonnaroo But I don t know if I m in Tennessee  Chicago  or Houston In the corner trying to seek solitude Shallow but such a hollow dude I won t even swallow solid food Alcoholic too  plus I m on lean like the Tower of Pisa Top it off I m on mushrooms so f ck all of you Roses are violet  mollies are blue Lost in a ball of confusion Its all an illusion It s probably the shrooms I m on Cause I think I started hallucinating Cause I just thought I just heard Jay Electronica and Odd Future s new shit And all I can do is follow the music And end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza Fillin  water balloons with nail polish remover Just to pop  em and wallow in fumes I feel uptight I gotta get looser After I finish polishing off this bottle of booze I got a solution Concentrated like orange juice so I m not as diluted Cause all this delusion got me seein  shit Excusez moi but that coochie that passed You see her ass  Wouldn t make her my main squeeze But juicier ass  it belongs in a juicer It s mouth waterin  too so I walked up to it like I m Marshall Wanna try to meet my standards  I ll Introduce ya Oh I m a misogynist too but I m not a masseuse But my attitude is rubbin  off on the youth A chronic abuser  not only user of marijuana I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of you losers Got a bazooka  a shotgun  a ruger  a Glock  and a nuke And a Rottweiler too  I m not in the mood so When I say I m bringing the TEC out I m not coming to repair your fuckin  electronic computers God  I m gonna puke I m so gone off the hookah I think I swallowed a loofah I m tore up  demolished  a fuckin  stone like Oliver Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her The thoughts I produce are loony tunes The box of usable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes To replace next up Veronica s boobs And uhh  paycheck stubs that were stuffed in the glove box In a blue Honda with used condoms were clues The girl was just not the one suitable for or  Right for me  will change me  rearrange my head to be Just right for you and me  don’t laugh  please listen Don’t laugh  please listen  Thought I’d give in to the pressure Collapse and crumble perhaps Relapsing under that Well that s a bunch of crap In the clutch  I m the Captain Crunch of rap And I m sick of acting humble  that s enough of that F ck that shit  cut the sack Like its a natural reaction That s why I m actually trapped in this shoving match Cause push keeps coming to that I can keep getting my ass kicked  I’m coming back Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit  still mad Disgruntled had some struggles yeah But that passionate hunger s back The fantastic juggling act And the way I flip my tongue on the track It s like verbal acrobatics But in fact Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic I fuckin  crashed my hovercraft After I strapped the duffel bag to my back And stuck the massive punchin  bag in it An elastic bungee strap  proper plaster  a thumb tack And a piece of plastic bubble wrap Went spastic and fuckin  snapped Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid Stumbled back  recovered  back flipped And landed on a gymnastic tumble mat And for my last trick  lunge on back lash On a NASA shuttle flap  fuckin  snapped the rudder in half Chuckled and laughed  buttaled my last rebuttal And just asked him to come crash And I grab my Go Go Gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress And ceramic construction hat Rubbed my magic mushroom tat Fell off then splat  get up from that Face taped to a waste paper basket Throw up then gas  lungs collapse And that s more likely than finding someone that s  Right for me  will change me  rearrange my head to be Just right for you and me  don’t laugh  please listen Don’t laugh  please listen  Couple of shots of Jäger Public intoxication  dis fuckin  combobulation Flooded with thoughts of anger While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin   You re top ten ain t cha   stop cause you fuckers are talkin  crazy And stop interrupting you re not even up in the conversation Whether you re punchin  a clock or famous Underground  pop  or nameless  whatever your job is I came to f ck with your occupation You re thinkin  just cause you came in with scrubs And you brought the scalpel and sponge The oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon Stuck in the operating room Once you done swapped your name with him Smuggled in Ronald Reagan Dug him up Donald Fagen While juggling waffles baking Fuckin  McDonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagle They flung it across the table Then bump it and knock it shake it Jumped and got in the way then disrupted my concentration I said f ck it and lost my patience Since they all woke up from sedation Ain t none of you Doctor Dre So then what does it got you thinkin  You can f ck with this operation Aftermath  still running hip hop amazing I m still pluggin  along No need for an assumption Here s confirmation I m up for the long duration I m just looking for something to walk away with Some pocket change and a little integrity Though I ll probably be jumpin  across the stage Till I m fuckin  Madonna s age and Stuck in an awkward place in my life But I shit you not like I m fucked up with constipation That day will come before I stumble upon some lady that’s  Right for me  will change me  rearrange my head to be Just right for you and me  don’t laugh  please listen Don’t laugh  please listen,Eminem

225,I guess you could consider it poetry But with me it started out with just words just words They started looking like puzzle pieces so I started Connecting them to each other  til they started to resemble blank canvases By this time I was an artist so I just started to see these pictures  these real visuals I m a psychopath  I m a killer  (I m a psychopath  I m a killer I m a psychopath  I m a killer A psychopath  I m a killer A psychopath  I m a killer)  Feelin  it in the air  breathe it in the night Sayin  I m a killer Did you ever think we would come to find  Maybe in my dreams  I m a psychopath  I m never keepin  it plain Lyrical murder is somethin  I ve been about Ever since I was a little kid  doodlin  in the class Drew a picture of my teacher  bullet in his head  ruler in his ass With a toilet in front of him  throwin  up  pissed off Prolly symbolic of this thought  sick tot To my inner enemy in a rush I m havin  nightmares of leavin  behind my dreams With anything less than a full bank It s like I m General Hong  and I m standin  in front of a gun I m puttin  myself in the way of a bullet to pull rank The hood is over my eyes but the wool ain t Yeah  got the mentality of bein  with a wizard Every award show  we don t even get considered How do you sell somethin  that s so lyrical To a kid that wouldn t know what was hittin  if it hit him  Now I wanna talk

227,Feels like a close  it’s coming to F ck am I gonna do  It s too late to start over This is the only thing I  thing I know  Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is Find different ways to word the same  old song Ever since I came along From the day the song called ‘’Hi  My Name Is’’ dropped Started thinking my name was fault  Cause anytime things went wrong I was the one who they would blame it on The media made me the equivalent of a modern day Genghis Khan Tried to argue it was only entertainment  dawg Gangsta  Naw  courageous balls Had to change my style  they said I m way too soft And I sound like AZ and Nas  out came the claws And the fangs been out since then But up until the instant that I’ve been against it It was ingrained in me that I wouldn’t amount to a shitstain I thought No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught Do I really belong in this game  I pondered I just wanna play my part  should I make waves or not  So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on And I don’t wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon But sometimes you gotta take a loss And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off And keep pluggin’  it’s your only outlet And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it Better find a way to counter it quick and make it  ah Feel like I’ve already said this a kabillion eighty times How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme  What I really wanna say is  is there anyone else that can relate to my story  Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are  I was afraid to Make a single sound Afraid I will never find a way out  out  out Afraid I never before I didn’t wanna go another round An angry man s power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip toe love Run out of excuses with every word So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear  (The time is here) Guts over fear  (I shall not tear) For all the times I let you push me around And let you keep me down (Now I got) Guts over fear  guts over fear  Feels like a close  it’s coming to F ck am I gonna do  It s too late to start over This is the only thing I  thing I know  I know what it was like  I was there once  single parents Hate your appearance  did you struggle to find your place in this world  And the pain spawns all the anger on But it wasn’t until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on That I made a spark  started to spit hard as shit Learned how to harness it while the reins were off And there was a lot of bizarre shit  but the crazy part Was soon as I stopped saying  I gave a f ck  Haters started to appreciate my art And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I’ve caused But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone  And the lights go out in the trailer park  And the window that was closing and there’s nowhere else I can go with flows in And I’m frozen cause there’s no more emotion for me to pull from Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same  old song But I’d rather make “Not Afraid 2” than making another mothafuckin’ “We Made You” uh Now I don’t wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs My demise and my uprise  pray to God I just opened enough eyes later on Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong And enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt  Cause I can’t explain to y’all how dang exhausted my legs felt Just having to balance my damn self But on eggshells I was made to walk But thank you  ma  ‘cause that gave me the Strength to cause Shady mania  so many empty that stadium At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done So this is for every kid who all’s they ever did was dreamt that one day just getting accepted I represent him or her  anyone similar  you are the reason that I made this song Everything you re scared to say don t be afraid to say no more From this day on forward  just let them a holes talk Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I’m gone And to think I was gone  I was afraid to Make a single sound Afraid I will never find a way out  out  out Afraid I never before I didn’t wanna go another round An angry man s power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip toe love Run out of excuses with every word So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear  (The time is here) Guts over fear  (I shall not tear) For all the times I let you push me around And let you keep me down (Now I got) Guts over fear  guts over fear,Eminem

230,I feel phenomenal as usual Pharmaceuticals  glue stick to crucify me at Bonnaroo But I don t know if I m in Tennessee  Chicago  or Houston In the corner trying to seek solitude Shallow but such a hollow dude I won t even swallow solid food Alcoholic too  plus I m on lean like the Tower of Pisa Top it off I m on mushrooms so f ck all of you Roses are violet  mollies are blue Lost in a ball of confusion Its all an illusion It s probably the shrooms I m on  Cause I think I started hallucinating  Cause I just thought I just heard Jay Electronica and Odd Future s new shit And all I can do is follow the music And end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza Fillin  water balloons with nail polish remover Just to pop  em and wallow in fumes I feel uptight I gotta get looser After I finish polishing off this bottle of booze I got a solution Concentrated like orange juice so I m not as diluted Cause all this delusion got me seein  shit Excusez moi but that coochie that passed You see her ass  Wouldn t make her my main squeeze But juicier ass  it belongs in a juicer It s mouth waterin  too so I walked up to it like I m Marshall Wanna try to meet my standards  I ll Introduce ya Oh I m a misogynist too but I m not a masseuse But my attitude is rubbin  off on the youth A chronic abuser  not only user of marijuana I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of you losers Got a bazooka  a shotgun  a ruger  a Glock  and a nuke And a Rottweiler too  I m not in the mood so When I say I m bringing the TEC out I m not coming to repair your fuckin  electronic computers God  I m gonna puke I m so gone off the hookah I think I swallowed a loofah I m tore up  demolished  a fuckin  stone like Oliver Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her The thoughts I produce are loony tunes The box of usable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes To replace next up Veronica s boobs And uhh  paycheck stubs that were stuffed in the glove box In a blue Honda with used condoms were clues The girl was just not the one suitable for or  Right for me  will change me  rearrange my head to be Just right for you and me  don’t laugh  please listen Don’t laugh  please listen  Thought I’d give in to the pressure Collapse and crumble perhaps Relapsing under that Well that s a bunch of crap In the clutch  I m the Captain Crunch of rap And I m sick of acting humble  that s enough of that F ck that shit  cut the sack Like its a natural reaction That s why I m actually trapped in this shoving match  Cause push keeps coming to that I can keep getting my ass kicked  I’m coming back Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit  still mad Disgruntled had some struggles yeah But that passionate hunger s back The fantastic juggling act And the way I flip my tongue on the track It s like verbal acrobatics But in fact Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic I fuckin  crashed my hovercraft After I strapped the duffel bag to my back And stuck the massive punchin  bag in it An elastic bungee strap  proper plaster  a thumb tack And a piece of plastic bubble wrap Went spastic and fuckin  snapped Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid Stumbled back  recovered  back flipped And landed on a gymnastic tumble mat And for my last trick  lunge on back lash On a NASA shuttle flap  fuckin  snapped the rudder in half Chuckled and laughed  buttaled my last rebuttal And just asked him to come crash And I grab my Go Go Gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress And ceramic construction hat Rubbed my magic mushroom tat Fell off then splat  get up from that Face taped to a waste paper basket Throw up then gas  lungs collapse And that s more likely than finding someone that s  Right for me  will change me  rearrange my head to be Just right for you and me  don’t laugh  please listen Don’t laugh  please listen  Couple of shots of Jäger Public intoxication  dis fuckin  combobulation Flooded with thoughts of anger While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin   You re top ten ain t cha   stop cause you fuckers are talkin  crazy And stop interrupting you re not even up in the conversation Whether you re punchin  a clock or famous Underground  pop  or nameless  whatever your job is I came to f ck with your occupation You re thinkin  just cause you came in with scrubs And you brought the scalpel and sponge The oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon Stuck in the operating room Once you done swapped your name with him Smuggled in Ronald Reagan Dug him up Donald Fagen While juggling waffles baking Fuckin  McDonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagle They flung it across the table Then bump it and knock it shake it Jumped and got in the way then disrupted my concentration I said f ck it and lost my patience Since they all woke up from sedation Ain t none of you Doctor Dre So then what does it got you thinkin  You can f ck with this operation Aftermath  still running hip hop amazing I m still pluggin  along No need for an assumption Here s confirmation I m up for the long duration I m just looking for something to walk away with Some pocket change and a little integrity Though I ll probably be jumpin  across the stage Till I m fuckin  Madonna s age and Stuck in an awkward place in my life But I shit you not like I m fucked up with constipation That day will come before I stumble upon some lady that’s  Right for me  will change me  rearrange my head to be Just right for you and me  don’t laugh  please listen Don’t laugh  please listen,Eminem

235,Yo  if you could just  for one minute  Or one split second in time  forget everything  Everything that bothers you  or your problems  Everything  and follow me    If I was frozen inside of a moment  If I could capture time inside a capsule  An hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand  it passes through it  If I can grasp it  and just control what happens to it  Then I can trap it  so no more time elapses through it  If raps could do it  maybe I could tap into it  Then I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks  To transmit through  em  to make you put your ass into it  And that s when you hit the roof because you can t sit through it  Your passions too much for you to not to be dancing to it  And as you do it  your movements become fast and fluent  You re mashin  to it  moshing until you re black and bluish  And shit you re acting foolish  this music it has influenced you to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion  True it s chaotic  but it s got your body moving as a unit  Uniting together tonight  so make it last and you better just    Lose yourself in this music  this moment we own it  We won t never let it go (go)  you better move yourself  Because tomorrow s ass can wait  There is no time  to sit there and procrastinate  Lose yourself in this music  this moment we own it  We won t never let it go (go)  you better move yourself  Because tomorrow s ass can wait  There is no time  to sit there and procrastinate     Cause when we descend together  we begin to move as one  In perfect unison just like the moon and sun  Illuminate the room and humans soon become aluminum  Rhythmically in sync  if you ll excuse the pun  But if you could lose it once  I mean if you could let shit go  Relax  take a breath  and just let it exit slow  Then rest your soul  You could leave the rest to me  if I could give the world a hit of ecstasy  To make  em feel the feeling I m feeling right this minute   Cause I feel like the night won t end til I get finished  So close the shades  makin  sure no light gets in it  The skies the limit tonight because the night s infinite  A high percentage  of black people and white mixed in it  But no one really gives a f ck because they just like what s spinnin   His life was spinnin   the whole entire night just spinnin   Like life s beginning so come out from inside your skin and quit hidin  in it    Lose yourself in this music  this moment we own it  We won t never let it go (go)  you better move yourself  Because tomorrow s ass can wait  There is no time  to sit there and procrastinate  Lose yourself in this music  this moment we own it  We won t never let it go (go)  you better move yourself  Because tomorrow s ass can wait  There is no time  to sit there and procrastinate,Eminem
236,I m liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought I disgust you like dialogue from The Shop to The Wired Frog Night club  shit  I was taught if your CD s on fire You had to put it out yourself like Highland Park  no fire department So you might not hear sirens at all But don t be alarmed if I sound off Something just ain t right with me  dawg A martyr on a private charter  whose life could be harder  Widely regarded highly  bite me  sweetheart  I m slightly retarded But tonight I m starting shit  I m feeling self righteous I might just hop in a mosh pit on some Mike Tyson and Pac shit Looking to box with anybody  disorderly conduct I ll f ck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith Fan of the LOX  bananas  manic  I m going in shock Frantic  I m trapped in a closet Panic attack cause I m claustrophobic No  faggot  I mean I can t maneuver from movement Cause I have no room for improvement I m practically squashed  unpacked it and boxed it Toxic  hands are arsenic  flammable bars  examine the content Bar exam  start of insanity Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson Animal snarls  cannibal jaws Shark mandibles  lambs to the slaughter Looking scamp as Hannibal stalking Anthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets Black out  Zach Galifianakis  gallons of Vodka But that gal has some knockers I bet you they ring a bell when I come back and I m conscious What happened  doc  I passed out again Alcohol s making me break into vacant s naked Stole a Magnum box and bag Cirocs in back of a Datsun Fell asleep watching Fear Factor and Scare Tactics Too close to the StairMaster Poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it Woke up shortly thereafter  hungover No underwear  grasping a Bayer Aspirin and dropped it Air Max in my closet  preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich And the cross stitching is a cross mixing Of a rhinoceros  possum skin  giraffe and a dolphin Fin Dockers  OshKoshes  drop crotches Swatch watches and sneakers matches with the Parkers But it s like being overstaffed at a boxing gym With all these trainers  but I don t have any boxers And I m standing here naked  hangover  still wasted Like paper you write raps on  obnoxious Yo  why does it always sound like I m grabbing my nostrils  F ck that  I ll battle  em all  I ll battle a mall I’ll stand there and yell that at a wall Until the mannequin doll scatter and the inanimate objects That I m battering all shatter and fall Cause I hear the track and I m starting to get fucking amped I mma spark plug  I m like the car with the cables hooked to my fucking back  I m a Duracell But I sure as hell got it backwards cause y all could get jumped And I d catch the battery charge  but I got a hunch like your back when it s arching When I start attacking your squadron You ll feel like MasterCard when I m charging So take a swipe at me  I m coming straight at you Like Clay Matthews from the Green Bay Packers So get the sack of Wisconsin That s nutbag that I m talking  who am I kidding  You faggots are all gonna do my bidding Don t get dragged to the auction Neiman Marcus  bags of Vuitton and all I ll push a bitch into oncoming traffic  just watch this Stretched  tinted  black sedan my ass See how mad you act when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave In a fucking taxi cab to go shopping Affable guy next door is laughable My next whore s gonna have mechanical arms That ll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor No emotion hence I guess this sick prick dies hard I got a Magic Johnson It s like a Magic Wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me If Ronda Rousey was on the couch with the condoms out Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me I ll laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around And all I see is Paulie Malign now  she s slaughterhouse in a blouse And Madonna with mud on her  God dammit I am misogynist I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster  throw her off a balcony Just so happens she s fond of algae Cause now she s faceplants on the concrete Complete lack of responsibility Half you assholes ain t strong enough to pick up a spirit Shit  you fags couldn t shoplift at a thrift shop But I let the track lift  em up  boost the energy Klepto  I m back to rip shop up  but my thing is this now Five finger discount Been rapping so long I ve been killing this shit  it s easy Kidnapping your mom cause I m still in this bitch  thievery Ransom for JonBenét Ramsey  Chandra Levy  and Gary Condit ( Em ) Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde I might relapse  get on some bullshit Perhaps I ll launch some cracker taunts at Action Bronson Macklemore  Mac Miller and Asher Roth And have some back and forths And record a wack response to Kendrick Lamar s  Control  verse And perform  Fack  in concert  Yo  I put that shit on a greatest hits album Now that was awesome It takes some massive balls to do some shit like that Sometimes I have to ponder why people are like (I ll stick around) And put up with my crap so long for What s the attraction  mama  Is it the fact that I m a walking  talking  actual quadruple entendre Or the pointy nose that s pointing at you  mama  Who knows at this point  it s always poking so meh Still get along with this voice cause that s the monster So do si do with a sociopath  everyone who knows me knows that What they don t know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio  meh She loves the way I lie Sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow Pathological liar  oh  why am I

238,Feels like a close  it’s coming to F ck am I gonna do  It s too late to start over This is the only thing I  thing I know  Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is Find different ways to word the same  old song Ever since I came along From the day the song called ‘’Hi  My Name Is’’ dropped Started thinking my name was fault  Cause anytime things went wrong I was the one who they would blame it on The media made me the equivalent of a modern day Genghis Khan Tried to argue it was only entertainment  dawg Gangsta  Naw  courageous balls Had to change my style  they said I m way too soft And I sound like AZ and Nas  out came the claws And the fangs been out since then But up until the instant that I’ve been against it It was ingrained in me that I wouldn’t amount to a shitstain I thought No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught Do I really belong in this game  I pondered I just wanna play my part  should I make waves or not  So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on And I don’t wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon But sometimes you gotta take a loss And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off And keep pluggin’  it’s your only outlet And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it Better find a way to counter it quick and make it  ah Feel like I’ve already said this a kabillion eighty times How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme  What I really wanna say is  is there anyone else that can relate to my story  Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are  I was afraid to Make a single sound Afraid I will never find a way out  out  out Afraid I never before I didn’t wanna go another round An angry man s power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip toe love Run out of excuses with every word So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear  (The time is here) Guts over fear  (I shall not tear) For all the times I let you push me around And let you keep me down (Now I got) Guts over fear  guts over fear  Feels like a close  it’s coming to F ck am I gonna do  It s too late to start over This is the only thing I  thing I know  I know what it was like  I was there once  single parents Hate your appearance  did you struggle to find your place in this world  And the pain spawns all the anger on But it wasn’t until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on That I made a spark  started to spit hard as shit Learned how to harness it while the reins were off And there was a lot of bizarre shit  but the crazy part Was soon as I stopped saying  I gave a f ck  Haters started to appreciate my art And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I’ve caused But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone  And the lights go out in the trailer park  And the window that was closing and there’s nowhere else I can go with flows in And I’m frozen cause there’s no more emotion for me to pull from Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same  old song But I’d rather make “Not Afraid 2” than making another mothafuckin’ “We Made You” uh Now I don’t wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs My demise and my uprise  pray to God I just opened enough eyes later on Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong And enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt  Cause I can’t explain to y’all how dang exhausted my legs felt Just having to balance my damn self But on eggshells I was made to walk But thank you  ma  ‘cause that gave me the Strength to cause Shady mania  so many empty that stadium At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done So this is for every kid who all’s they ever did was dreamt that one day just getting accepted I represent him or her  anyone similar  you are the reason that I made this song Everything you re scared to say don t be afraid to say no more From this day on forward  just let them a holes talk Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I’m gone And to think I was gone  I was afraid to Make a single sound Afraid I will never find a way out  out  out Afraid I never before I didn’t wanna go another round An angry man s power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip toe love Run out of excuses with every word So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear  (The time is here) Guts over fear  (I shall not tear) For all the times I let you push me around And let you keep me down (Now I got) Guts over fear  guts over fear,Eminem

241,I feel phenomenal as usual Pharmaceuticals  glue stick to crucify me at Bonnaroo But I don t know if I m in Tennessee  Chicago  or Houston In the corner trying to seek solitude Shallow but such a hollow dude I won t even swallow solid food Alcoholic too  plus I m on lean like the Tower of Pisa Top it off I m on mushrooms so f ck all of you Roses are violet  mollies are blue Lost in a ball of confusion Its all an illusion It s probably the shrooms I m on Cause I think I started hallucinating Cause I just thought I just heard Jay Electronica and Odd Future s new shit And all I can do is follow the music And end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza Fillin  water balloons with nail polish remover Just to pop  em and wallow in fumes I feel uptight I gotta get looser After I finish polishing off this bottle of booze I got a solution Concentrated like orange juice so I m not as diluted Cause all this delusion got me seein  shit Excusez moi but that coochie that passed You see her ass  Wouldn t make her my main squeeze But juicier ass  it belongs in a juicer It s mouth waterin  too so I walked up to it like I m Marshall Wanna try to meet my standards  I ll Introduce ya Oh I m a misogynist too but I m not a masseuse But my attitude is rubbin  off on the youth A chronic abuser  not only user of marijuana I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of you losers Got a bazooka  a shotgun  a ruger  a Glock  and a nuke And a Rottweiler too  I m not in the mood so When I say I m bringing the TEC out I m not coming to repair your fuckin  electronic computers God  I m gonna puke I m so gone off the hookah I think I swallowed a loofah I m tore up  demolished  a fuckin  stone like Oliver Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her The thoughts I produce are loony tunes The box of usable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes To replace next up Veronica s boobs And uhh  paycheck stubs that were stuffed in the glove box In a blue Honda with used condoms were clues The girl was just not the one suitable for or  Right for me  will change me  rearrange my head to be Just right for you and me  don’t laugh  please listen Don’t laugh  please listen  Thought I’d give in to the pressure Collapse and crumble perhaps Relapsing under that Well that s a bunch of crap In the clutch  I m the Captain Crunch of rap And I m sick of acting humble  that s enough of that F ck that shit  cut the sack Like its a natural reaction That s why I m actually trapped in this shoving match Cause push keeps coming to that I can keep getting my ass kicked  I’m coming back Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit  still mad Disgruntled had some struggles yeah But that passionate hunger s back The fantastic juggling act And the way I flip my tongue on the track It s like verbal acrobatics But in fact Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic I fuckin  crashed my hovercraft After I strapped the duffel bag to my back And stuck the massive punchin  bag in it An elastic bungee strap  proper plaster  a thumb tack And a piece of plastic bubble wrap Went spastic and fuckin  snapped Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid Stumbled back  recovered  back flipped And landed on a gymnastic tumble mat And for my last trick  lunge on back lash On a NASA shuttle flap  fuckin  snapped the rudder in half Chuckled and laughed  buttaled my last rebuttal And just asked him to come crash And I grab my Go Go Gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress And ceramic construction hat Rubbed my magic mushroom tat Fell off then splat  get up from that Face taped to a waste paper basket Throw up then gas  lungs collapse And that s more likely than finding someone that s  Right for me  will change me  rearrange my head to be Just right for you and me  don’t laugh  please listen Don’t laugh  please listen  Couple of shots of Jäger Public intoxication  dis fuckin  combobulation Flooded with thoughts of anger While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin   You re top ten ain t cha   stop cause you fuckers are talkin  crazy And stop interrupting you re not even up in the conversation Whether you re punchin  a clock or famous Underground  pop  or nameless  whatever your job is I came to f ck with your occupation You re thinkin  just cause you came in with scrubs And you brought the scalpel and sponge The oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon Stuck in the operating room Once you done swapped your name with him Smuggled in Ronald Reagan Dug him up Donald Fagen While juggling waffles baking Fuckin  McDonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagle They flung it across the table Then bump it and knock it shake it Jumped and got in the way then disrupted my concentration I said f ck it and lost my patience Since they all woke up from sedation Ain t none of you Doctor Dre So then what does it got you thinkin  You can f ck with this operation Aftermath  still running hip hop amazing I m still pluggin  along No need for an assumption Here s confirmation I m up for the long duration I m just looking for something to walk away with Some pocket change and a little integrity Though I ll probably be jumpin  across the stage Till I m fuckin  Madonna s age and Stuck in an awkward place in my life But I shit you not like I m fucked up with constipation That day will come before I stumble upon some lady that’s  Right for me  will change me  rearrange my head to be Just right for you and me  don’t laugh  please listen Don’t laugh  please listen,Eminem

271,It s like I m in the dirt  digging up old hurt  Tried everything to get my mind off you  it won t work  All it takes is one song on the radio you re right back on it  Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off  And left me so burned  spent a lot of time trying to soul search  Maybe I needed to grow up a little first  Looks like I hit a growth spurt  But I am coming for closure  Don t suppose an explanation I m owed for  The way that you turned your back on me  Just when I may have needed you most  Oh  you thought it was over  You can just close the chapter  And go about your life  like it was nothing  You ruined mine  but you seem to be doing fine  I d never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha   Bout to go through s tougher than anything I ever have suffered  Can t think of a better way to define poetic justice  Can I hold grudges  mind is saying:  let it go  f ck this   Heart is saying:  I will once I bury this bitch alive  Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset     I flee the scene like it was my last ride  You see right through  Oh  you had me pegged the first time  You can t see the truth  But it s easier to justify  What s bad is good  And I hate to be the bad guy  I just hate to be the bad guy    And to think I used to think you was the shit  bitch  To think it was you at one time I worshiped  shit  Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it   Not this time  you better go and get sewing kit  bitch  Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow  nitwit  Thought some time had past and I forget it  forget it   You left our family in shambles  You expect me to just get over him  Pretend he never existed  Maybe gone  but he s not forgotten  And don t think  cause he s been out the pictures so long  That I ve stopped the plottin  and still ain t coming to get ya  You re wrong and that shit was rotten  And the way you played him  same shit you did to me  Have you any idea that shit I ve gone through   Feelings I harbor  all this pain of resentment I hold on to  Not once you called to ask me how I m doing  Letters  you don t respond to  em  F ck it  I m coming to see you  And gee who better to talk to than you   The cause to my problems  My life is garbage and I m  bout to take it out on you  Poof  then I m gone    I flee the scene like it was my last ride  You see right through  Oh  you had me pegged the first time  You can t see the truth  But it s easier to justify  What s bad is good  And I hate to be the bad guy  I just hate to be the bad guy  Hate to be the bad guy    I ve been driving around your side of the town  Like nine frickin  hours and forty five minutes now  Finally I found your new address  park in your drive  Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life  And it s now arrived  and my mouth is full of saliva  My knife is out and I m ducking on the side of your house  See  it s sad it came to this point  Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya  But ain t here for ya empathy  I don t need your apology  Or your friendship of sympathy  it s revenge that I seek  So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window  Like I reach my full potential  I peeked  Continue to peep  still bent low  Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo  Sneak all the way  round to the back porch  Man  door handles unlocked  shouldn t be that easy to do this  You don t plan for intruders before hand   Surprised to see me  Cat got your tongue   Gag  chloroform rag  gag almost hack of a lung  Like you picked up an axe up and then swung  Stick to the core plan  drag to the back of a trunk  By one of your fans  irony spectacular  huh   Now who s a faggot  you punk   And here s your Bronco hat  you can have that shit back as they suck    It s just me  you and the music now  Slim  I hope you hear it we are in a car right now  Wait  here comes my favorite lyric  I m the bad guy who makes fun of people that die  And hey  here s a sequel to my Mathers LP  Just to try to get people to buy  How s this for publicity stunt  This should be fun  Last album now  cause after this you ll be officially done  Eminem killed by Eminem  Matthew Mitchell  bitch  I even have your initials  I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother  but f ck it  Since you love your city so much  I figured  what the f ck the best place you could be buried alive is right here  Two more exits  town is quite near  I hope we don t get stopped  no license I fear  That sirens I hear  Guess 90 on the freeway wasn t the brightest idea  As cops appear in my driver side mirror  (Help  god police  ah  )  Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial  New plan Stan  Slim  chauvinist pig drove in this big  Lincoln town car  Well gotta go  almost at the bridge  haha big bro it s for you  Slim  this is for him and Frank Ocean  hope you can swim good   Now say you hate homos again     I also represent anyone normally seen on the end of these jokes of a beat  I m the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in  I m your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen  Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin  No  it s hopeless  I m the denial that you re hopelessly in  When they say all of this is approaching its end  But you refuse to believe that it s over  here we go all over again    Backs to the wall  I’m stacking up all them odds  toilets clogged  Yeah  cause I’m talking a lot of shit but I’m backing it all up  But in my head there’s a voice in the back and it hollas  After the track is demolished  I am your lack of a conscience  I’m the ringing in your ears  I’m the polyps on the back of your tonsils  Eating your vocal chords after your concerts  I’m your time that’s almost up that you haven’t acknowledged  Grab for some water but I’m that pill that’s too jagged to swallow  I’m the bullies you hate that you became  With every faggot you slaughtered  Coming back on you every woman you insult there  With the double standards you have when it comes to your daughters  I represent everything you take for granted   Cause Marshall Mather’s the rapper’s persona’s have a facade and  Matthew and Stan’s just symbolic of you not knowing what you had until it’s gone   Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name  Cameras are off  sad but it happens to all of them   I m the hindsight to say  “I told you so ”  Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow  I m the future that s here to show you what happens tomorrow  If you don’t stop after they call you  The biggest laughing stock of rap who can’t call it quits  But it’s time to walk away  I’m ever guilt trip the baggage you had  But as you gather up all your possessions  If there s anything you have left to say  Unless it makes an impact don t bother  So before you rest your case  Better make sure you re packing a wallop    So one last time  I’m back  Before it fades into black and it’s all over  Behold the final chapter in the saga  Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle  Twice the magic that started it all  Tragic portrait of an artist tortured  Trapped in his own drawings  Tap into thoughts  Blacker and darker than anything imaginable  Here goes a wild stab in the dark  As we pick up the last Mathers’ left off,Eminem

You were just what the doctor ordered    I m beginning to feel like a Rap God  Rap God  All my people from the front to the back nod  back nod  Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box  slap box   They said I rap like a robot  so call me Rapbot    But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes  I got a laptop in my back pocket  My pen ll go off when I half cock it  Got a fat knot from that rap profit  Made a living and a killing off it  Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office  With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut sack  I m an MC still as honest  But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables  killaholic (Kill  em all with)  This slickety  gibbedy  hibbedy hip hop  You don t really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap  Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac  pack backpack rap  yep  yackidy yac  The exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I m practicing  That I ll still be able to break a motherfuckin  table  Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half  Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact  How could I not blow  All I do is drop F bombs  feel my wrath of attack  Rappers are having a rough time period  here s a Maxipad  It s actually disastrously bad  For the wack while I m masterfully constructing this masterpiece as    I m beginning to feel like a Rap God  Rap God  All my people from the front to the back nod  back nod  Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box  slap box   Let me show you maintaining this shit ain t that hard  that hard    Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got  Well  to be truthful the blueprint s simply rage and youthful exuberance  Everybody loves to root for a nuisance  Hit the earth like an asteroid  did nothing but shoot for the moon since  MC s get taken to school with this music   Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme  Now I lead a new school full of students  Me  I m a product of Rakim  Lakim Shabazz  2Pac N    W A  Cube  hey  Doc  Ren  Yella  Eazy  thank you  they got Slim  Inspired enough to one day grow up  blow up and be in a position  To meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherfuckin  Rock n   Roll Hall of Fame  Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames  Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame  On the wall of shame  You fags think it s all a game  til I walk a flock of flames  Off of planking  tell me what in the f ck are you thinking   Little gay looking boy  So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy  You witnessing a massacre  Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy  Oy vey  that boy s gay  that s all they say looking boy  You get a thumbs up  pat on the back  And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy  Hey  looking boy  what you say looking boy   I got a  hell yeah  from Dre looking boy  I mma work for everything I have  Never ask nobody for shit  get outta my face looking boy  Basically boy you re never gonna be capable  To keep up with the same pace looking boy     Cause I m beginning to feel like a Rap God  Rap God  All my people from the front to the back nod  back nod  The way I m racing around the track  call me Nascar  Nascar  Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park  the White Trash God  Kneel before General Zod this planet s Krypton  no Asgard  Asgard    So you be Thor and I ll be Odin  you rodent  I m omnipotent  Let off then I m reloading immediately with these bombs I m totin   And I should not be woken  I m the walking dead  but I m just a talking head  a zombie floating  But I got your mom deep throating  I m out my ramen noodle  we have nothing in common  poodle  I m a doberman  pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage  pupil  It s me  my honesty s brutal  But it s honestly futile if I don t utilize what I do though  For good at least once in a while  So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle  Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times  But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned  Rappers are hungry looking at me like it s lunchtime  I know there was a time where once I  Was king of the underground  but I still rap like I m on my Pharoahe Monch grind  So I crunch rhymes  but sometimes when you combine  Appeal with the skin color of mine  You get too big and here they come trying to   Censor you like that one line I said on  I m Back  from the Marshall Mathers LP  One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine  Put  em all in a line  add an AK 47  a revolver and a nine  See if I get away with it now that I ain t as big as I was  but I ve  Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal  You re stuck in a time warp from 2004 though  And I don t know what the f ck that you rhyme for  You re pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows  You re like normal  f ck being normal  And I just bought a new Raygun from the future  To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad   Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad  Singin  to a man while they played piano  Man  oh man  that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel  So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day   Hey  Fab  I mma kill you   Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed  (JJ Fad)  Uh  sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I m a human  What I gotta do to get it through to you I m superhuman  Innovative and I m made of rubber  So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it ll glue to you  I m never stating  more than never demonstrating  How to give a motherfuckin  audience a feeling like it s levitating  Never fading  and I know that the haters are forever waiting  For the day that they can say I fell off  they d be celebrating  Cause I know the way to get  em motivated  I make elevating music  you make elevator music  Oh  he s too mainstream  Well  that s what they do when they get jealous  they confuse it  It s not hip hop  it s pop  cause I found a hella way to fuse it  With rock  shock rap with Doc  Throw on Lose Yourself and make  em lose it  I don t know how to make songs like that  I don t know what words to use  Let me know when it occurs to you  While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you  It’s curtains  I’m inadvertently hurtin  you  How many verses I gotta murder to   Prove that if you re half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh   School flunkie  pill junky  But look at the accolades the skills brung me  Full of myself  but still hungry  I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to  And I m a million leagues above you  ill when I speak in tongues  But it s still tongue in cheek  f ck you  I m drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel  I m asleep in the front seat  Bumping Heavy D and the Boys  still chunky  but funky  But in my head there s something I can feel tugging and struggling  Angels fight with devils  here s what they want from me  They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate  But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had  Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation  And understand the discrimination  But f ck it  life s handing you lemons  make lemonade then  But if I can t batter the women how the f ck am I supposed to bake them a cake then   Don t mistake it for Satan  It s a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas  And take a vacation to trip a broad  And make her fall on her face and don t be a retard  Be a king  Think not  why be a king when you can be a,Eminem

butter is bad for my health  but  I think there s more white trash from the trailer  Jed Clampett  Redd Sanford welfare mentality helps to  Keep me grounded  that s why I never take full advantage of wealth  I  Managed to dwell within these parameters  Still cramming the shelves full of hamburger helper  I can t even help it  this is the hand I was dealt to  Creature of habit  feel like I m trapped in an animal shelter  With all these pet peeves  God dammit to hell  I can t stand all these kids with their camera cellphones  I can t go anywhere  I get so mad I can yell  the  Other day

297,I came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain An asshole  that role I think I succeed fulfilling But don t think I ever stopped To think I was speaking to children Everything was happening so fast It was like I blinked  sold three million  Then it all went blank  all I remember Is feeling ridiculous  cause I was getting sick of this feeling Like I am always under attack man I could have stacked my shit list to the ceiling Women dish him but really thinking If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him  Guess I m a little bit of a hypocrite When I m ripping shit  but since when did this many People ever give a shit but I had to say It s just my opinion If it contradicts how I m living Put a dick in your rear end and guess what Every time you mention a lyric  I thank you for it  For drawing more attention toward it  Cause it gave me an enormous platform of platitude Thought I was that important But you can t ignore the fact that I fought for the respect And battle for it  mad awards  act paranoid Attaboy  they told me to slow down  and I just zone out  Good luck trying to convince a blonde That s like telling Gwen Stefan  she sold out  Cause I was tryna leave  no doubt In anyone s mind one day I d go down In history think they know now Because everybody knows  Everybody knows that you re just an asshole Everywhere that you go  people wanna go  Oh  everyone knows  Everybody knows  so don t pretend to be nice There s no place you can hide You are just an asshole Everyone knows  everyone knows  Thanks for the support  asshole [ scratch ] thanks for the support  asshole Quit acting salty  I was counting on you to count me out as Asher Roth When he round a bout dissed me to shout me out Thought I was history But goddamn  honkey  that compliment s like backhanding a donkey Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth Lay em off it  But what the f ck is all this thrash talking about The fight was fixed  I m back and you can t stop me You knock me down  I went down from the count I fell but the fans caught me  and now You re gonna have to beat the fuckin pants off me To take my belt  word to Pacquiao  Momma said there ain t nothing else to talk about Gotta go in that ring and knock them out Or you better not come out It s poetry in motion  like Freddie Roach when he s quoting Shakespeare So what if the insults are revolting  Even Helen Keller knows life stinks You think it s a joke til you re bullet riddled But you should give little shit what I think This whole world is a mess Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest  and a Glock Just to go out watch Batman  Who needs a test to test the testicles  not that man Half of you don t got the guts and intestinal blockage Rest of you got lap bands stuck to this model Before they put bath salts and all those water bottles in Colorado So get lost  Waldo  My soul s escaping through this asshole that is gaping A black hole that I m swallowing this track whole With a pack torn of paper But I m not taking no crap  ho Here I go down the back pole And I m changing back into that old maniac in fact there it go Trying to dip through the back door retreating  cause everybody knows  Everybody knows that you re just an asshole Everywhere that you go  people wanna go  Oh  everyone knows  Everybody knows  so don t pretend to be nice There s no place you can hide You are just an asshole Everyone knows  everyone knows  Holy mackeral  I m the biggest jerk on the planet earth I smack the girl off the mechanical bull  then attract the bull Thinkin  we have some magnetic pull Then scream  ICP in this bitch  how the f ck do magnets work    Cause you re attractive  but we ain t attractable Hate to be dramatical  but I m not romantical I m making up words

feelings locked in a vault So it s safe to say I m uncrackable My heart is truly guarded  full body armor Bitch you just need a helmet because if you think you re special  you re retarded  Thinkin  you re one of a kind  like you got some platinum vagina  You re a train wreck  I got a one track mind Shorty you re fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er  Cause you been a gold digger since you were a minor  Been tryina  hunt me down like a dog   cause you re on my ass But you can t get a scent because all of my spare time is spent With my nose in this binder  so don t bother tryin  Only women that I love are my daughters And sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I m a father  and I push it farther So father forgive me if I forget to draw the line It s apparent I shouldn t of been a parent I ll never grow up So to hell with your parents  and motherfucking father time And it ain t never gonna stop   A pessimist who transforms you to Optimus in his prime  So even if I m half dead  I m half alive Throw all my half empty glass in a cup  now my cup is runneth over And I m about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster  I m goin  back to what got me here  yeah cocky  and

299,It s like I m in the dirt  digging up old hurt Tried everything to get my mind off you  it won t work All it takes is one song on the radio  you re right back on it Reminding me all over again how you just brushed me off And left me so burned  spent a lot of time trying to soul search Maybe I needed to grow up a little first Well  looks like I hit a growth spurt But I m coming for closure Don t suppose an explanation I m owed for The way that you turned your back on me Just when I may have needed you most Oh  you thought it was over You can just close the chapter And go about your life  like it was nothing You ruined mine  but you seem to be doing fine Well  I ve never recovered but tonight betcha that whatcha  Bout to go through s tougher than anything I ever have suffered Can t think of a better way to define poetic justice Can I hold grudges  Mind s saying   let it go  fu  this  Heart s saying   I will once I bury this bi  alive Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset   I flee the scene like it was my last ride You see right through Oh  you had me pegged the first time You can t see the truth But it s easier to justify What s bad is good And I hate to be the bad guy I just hate to be the bad guy  I just hate to be the bad guy  And to think I used to think you was the shh To think it was you at one time I worshiped  shh Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it  Not this time  you better go and get the sewing kit  bi  Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow  nitwit Thought some time had passed and I d forget it  forget it You left our family in shambles And you expect me to just get over him  Pretend he never existed Maybe gone  but he s not forgotten And don t think  cause he s been out the picture so long That I ve stopped the plottin  and still ain t coming to get ya You re wrong and that ish was rotten And the way you played him  same ish you did to me  cold Have you any idea the ish I ve gone through  Feelings I harbor  All this pent up resentment I hold on to Not once you called to ask me how I m doing Letters  you don t respond to  em Fu  it  I m coming to see you And gee  who better to talk to than you  The cause to my problems My life is garbage and I m  bout to take it out on you Poof  then I m gone  woosh  I flee the scene like it was my last ride You see right through Oh  you had me pegged the first time You can t see the truth But it s easier to justify What s bad is good And I hate to be the bad guy I just hate to be the bad guy (follow me  I run  I run  follow me  I run  I run) I just hate to be the bad guy (follow me  I run  I run  follow me  I run  I run)  I ve been driving around your side of this town Like nine frickin  hours and forty five minutes now Finally  I found your new address  park in your drive Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life And it s now arrived  and my mouth is full of saliva My knife is out and I m ducking on the side of your house See  it s sad it came to this point Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya But ain t here for your empathy  I don t need your apology Or your friendship or sympathy  it s revenge that I seek So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window Like I reach my full potential  I peeked Continue to peep  still bent low Then keep tapping the glass lightly  then start to crescendo Sneak all the way  round to the back porch Man  door handles unlocked  shouldn t be that easy to do this You don t plan for intruders beforehand  Surprised to see me  Cat got your tongue  Gag  chloroform rag  gag  almost hack up a lung Like you picked an axe up and swung Stick to the core plan  dragged to the back of a trunk By one of your fans  irony spectacular  huh  Now who s a f   you punk  And here s your Bronco hat  you can have that shh back  cause they suck  It s just me  you and the music now  Slim I hope you hear it  we re in the car right now Wait  here comes my favorite lyric I m the bad guy who makes fun of people that die And hey  here s a sequel to my Mathers LP Just to try to get people to buy How s this for publicity stunt  This should be fun Last album now  cause after this you ll be officially done Eminem killed by Eminem Matthew Mitchell  bitch  I even have your initials I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother  but fu  it Since you re love with your city so much I figured  what the fu   the best place you could be buried alive is right here Two more exits  time is quite near Hope we don t get stopped  no license I fear That sirens I hear  Guess ninety on the freeway wasn t the brightest idea As cops appear in my driver side mirror (Oh  God  police  ah) Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot  at least New plan  Stan Slim   chauvinist pig  drove in this big Lincoln town car  Well  gotta go  almost at the bridge  big bro  it s for you Slim  this is for him and Frank Ocean  oh  hope you can swim good Now say you hate homos again  I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend I m the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in I m your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin Nope  it s hopeless  I m the denial that you re hopelessly in When they say all of this is approaching its end But you refuse to believe that it s over  here we go all over again Back s to the wall  I m stacking up all them odds  toilet s clogged Yeah   cause I m talking a lotta shit but I m backing it all up But in my head there s a voice in the back and it hollers After the track is demolished  I am your lack of a conscience  I m the ringing in your ears I m the polyps on the back of your tonsils Eating your vocal chords after your concerts I m your time that s almost up that you haven t acknowledged Grab for some water but I m that pill that s too jagged to swallow I m the bullies you hate that you became With every f  you slaughtered Coming back on you every woman you insult  batter But the double standards you have when it comes to your daughters I represent everything you take for granted  Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper s persona s half a façade and Matthew and Stan just symbolic of you not knowing what you had  til it s gone  Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name Cameras are off  sad but it happens to all of them I m the hindsight to say   I told you so  Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow I m the future that s here to show you what happens tomorrow If you don t stop after they call you Biggest laughing stock of rap who can t call it quits When it s time to walk away I m every guilt trip the baggage you have But as you gather up all your possessions If there s anything you have left to say Unless it makes an impact then don t bother So before you rest your case Better make sure you re packing a wallop  So one last time  I m back Before it fades into black and it s all over Behold the final chapter in the saga Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle Twice  the magic that started it all Tragic portrait of an artist tortured Trapped in his own drawings Tap into thoughts Blacker and darker than anything imaginable Here goes a wild stab in the dark As we pick up where the last Mathers  left off,Eminem

305,I came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain An a  hole  that role I think I succeed fulfilling But don t think I ever stopped To think I was speaking to children Everything was happening so fast It was like I blinked  sold three million  Then it all went blank  all I remember Is feeling ridiculous  cause I was getting sick of this feeling Like I am always under attack man I could have stacked my s    list to the ceiling Women dish him but really thinking If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him  Guess I m a little bit of a hypocrite When I m ripping s     but since when did this many People ever give a s    but I had to say It s just my opinion If it contradicts how I m living Put a dick in your rear end and guess what Every time you mention a lyric  I thank you for it  For drawing more attention toward it  Cause it gave me an enormous platform of platitude Thought I was that important But you can t ignore the fact that I fought for the respect And battle for it  mad awards  act paranoid Attaboy  they told me to slow down  and I just zone out  Good luck trying to convince a blonde That s like telling Gwen Stefan  she sold out  Cause I was tryna leave  no doubt In anyone s mind one day I d go down In history think they know now Because everybody knows  Everybody knows that you re just an a  hole Everywhere that you go  people wanna go  Oh  everyone knows  Everybody knows  so don t pretend to be nice There s no place you can hide You are just an a  hole Everyone knows  everyone knows  Thanks for the support  a  hole [ scratch ] thanks for the support  a  hole Quit acting salty  I was counting on you to count me out as Asher Roth When he round a bout dissed me to shout me out Thought I was history But goddamn  honkey  that compliment s like backhanding a donkey Good way to get your a   socked in the mouth Lay em off it  But what the f    is all this thrash talking about The fight was fixed  I m back and you can t stop me You knock me down  I went down from the count I fell but the fans caught me  and now You re gonna have to beat the f   in pants off me To take my belt  word to Pacquiao  Momma said there ain t nothing else to talk about Gotta go in that ring and knock them out Or you better not come out It s poetry in motion  like Freddie Roach when he s quoting Shakespeare So what if the insults are revolting  Even Helen Keller knows life stinks You think it s a joke til you re bullet riddled But you should give little s    what I think This whole world is a mess Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest  and a Glock Just to go out watch Batman  Who needs a test to test the testicles  not that man Half of you don t got the guts and intestinal blockage Rest of you got lap bands stuck to this model Before they put bath salts and all those water bottles in Colorado So get lost  Waldo  My soul s escaping through this a  hole that is gaping A black hole that I m swallowing this track whole With a pack torn of paper But I m not taking no crap  ho Here I go down the back pole And I m changing back into that old maniac in fact there it go Trying to dip through the back door retreating  cause everybody knows  Everybody knows that you re just an a  hole Everywhere that you go  people wanna go  Oh  everyone knows  Everybody knows  so don t pretend to be nice There s no place you can hide You are just an a  hole Everyone knows  everyone knows  Holy mackeral  I m the biggest jerk on the planet earth I smack the girl off the mechanical bull  then attract the bull Thinkin  we have some magnetic pull Then scream  ICP in this b      how the f    do magnets work    Cause you re attractive  but we ain t attractable Hate to be dramatical  but I m not romantical I m making up words you can understandable  it s tragical Thinkin  some magical s    s gonna happen  That ain t practical  You crackin  a joke  it s laughable   cause me and love s like a bad combination I keep them feelings locked in a vault So it s safe to say I m uncrackable My heart is truly guarded  full body armor B     you just need a helmet because if you think you re special  you re retarded  Thinkin

307,Look  I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings  But I m only going to get this one chance  Something s wrong  I can feel it (Six minutes  Slim Shady  you re on)  Just a feeling I ve got  like something s about to happen  but I don t know what  If that means  what I think it means  we re in trouble  big trouble   And if he is as bananas as you say  I m not taking any chances  You were just what the doctor ordered    I m beginning to feel like a Rap God  Rap God  All my people from the front to the back nod  back nod  Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box  slap box   They said I rap like a robot  so call me Rapbot    But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes  I got a laptop in my back pocket  My pen ll go off when I half c    it  Got a fat knot from that rap profit  Made a living and a killing off it  Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office  With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut sack  I m an MC still as honest  But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables  killaholic (Kill  em all with)  This slickety  gibbedy  hibbedy hip hop  You don t really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap  Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac  pack backpack rap  yep  yackidy yac  The exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I m practicing  That I ll still be able to break a motherf   in  table  Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half  Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact  How could I not blow  All I do is drop F bombs  feel my wrath of attack  Rappers are having a rough time period  here s a Maxipad  It s actually disastrously bad  For the wack while I m masterfully constructing this masterpiece as    I m beginning to feel like a Rap God  Rap God  All my people from the front to the back nod  back nod  Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box  slap box   Let me show you maintaining this s    ain t that hard  that hard    Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got  Well  to be truthful the blueprint s simply rage and youthful exuberance  Everybody loves to root for a nuisance  Hit the earth like an asteroid  did nothing but shoot for the moon since  MC s get taken to school with this music  Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme  Now I lead a new school full of students  Me  I m a product of Rakim  Lakim Shabazz  2Pac N    W A  Cube  hey  Doc  Ren  Yella  Eazy  thank you  they got Slim  Inspired enough to one day grow up  blow up and be in a position  To meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherf   in  Rock n   Roll Hall of Fame  Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames  Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame  On the wall of shame  You fags think it s all a game  til I walk a flock of flames  Off of planking  tell me what in the f    are you thinking   Little gay looking boy  So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy  You witnessing a massacre  Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy  Oy vey  that boy s gay  that s all they say looking boy  You get a thumbs up  pat on the back  And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy  Hey  looking boy  what you say looking boy   I got a  hell yeah  from Dre looking boy  I mma work for everything I have  Never ask nobody for s     get outta my face looking boy  Basically boy you re never gonna be capable  To keep up with the same pace looking boy     Cause I m beginning to feel like a Rap God  Rap God  All my people from the front to the back nod  back nod  The way I m racing around the track  call me Nascar  Nascar  Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park  the White Trash God  Kneel before General Zod this planet s Krypton  no Asgard  Asgard    So you be Thor and I ll be Odin  you rodent  I m omnipotent  Let off then I m reloading immediately with these bombs I m totin   And I should not be woken  I m the walking dead  but I m just a talking head  a zombie floating  But I got your mom deep throating  I m out my ramen noodle  we have nothing in common  poodle  I m a doberman  pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage  pupil  It s me  my honesty s brutal  But it s honestly futile if I don t utilize what I do though  For good at least once in a while  So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle  Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times  But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned  Rappers are hungry looking at me like it s lunchtime  I know there was a time where once I  Was king of the underground  but I still rap like I m on my Pharoahe Monch grind  So I crunch rhymes  but sometimes when you combine  Appeal with the skin color of mine  You get too big and here they come trying to   Censor you like that one line I said on  I m Back  from the Marshall Mathers LP  One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine  Put  em all in a line  add an AK 47  a revolver and a nine  See if I get away with it now that I ain t as big as I was  but I ve  Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal  You re stuck in a time warp from 2004 though  And I don t know what the f    that you rhyme for  You re pointless as Rapunzel with f   ing cornrows  You re like normal  f    being normal  And I just bought a new Raygun from the future  To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad   Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad  Singin  to a man while they played piano  Man  oh man  that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel  So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day   Hey  Fab  I mma kill you   Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed  (JJ Fad)  Uh  sama lamaa duma lamaa you a  uming I m a human  What I gotta do to get it through to you I m superhuman  Innovative and I m made of rubber  So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it ll glue to you  I m never stating  more than never demonstrating  How to give a motherf   in  audience a feeling like it s levitating  Never fading  and I know that the haters are forever waiting  For the day that they can say I fell off  they d be celebrating  Cause I know the way to get  em motivated  I make elevating music  you make elevator music  Oh  he s too mainstream  Well  that s what they do when they get jealous  they confuse it  It s not hip hop  it s pop  cause I found a hella way to fuse it  With rock  shock rap with Doc  Throw on Lose Yourself and make  em lose it  I don t know how to make songs like that  I don t know what words to use  Let me know when it occurs to you  While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you  It’s curtains  I’m inadvertently hurtin  you  How many verses I gotta murder to   Prove that if you re half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh   School flunkie  pill junky  But look at the accolades the skills brung me  Full of myself  but still hungry  I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to  And I m a million leagues above you  ill when I speak in tongues  But it s still tongue in cheek  f    you  I m drunk so Satan take the f   ing wheel  I m asleep in the front seat  Bumping Heavy D and the Boys  still chunky  but funky  But in my head there s something I can feel tugging and struggling  Angels fight with devils  here s what they want from me  They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate  But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had  Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation  And understand the discrimination  But f    it  life s handing you lemons  make lemonade then  But if I can t batter the women how the f    am I supposed to bake them a cake then   Don t mistake it for Satan  It s a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas  And take a vacation to trip a broad  And make her fall on her face and don t be a retard  Be a king  Think not  why be a king when you can be a ,Eminem

314,Yeah  trying to figure out the difference But I think I think the lines are starting to get blurry  I m in a strange place I feel like Mase when he gave up the game for his faith I feel like I m caged in these chains and restraints Grinning every stranger in the place while I gaze into space  Cause I m mentally rearranging his face  I need a change of pace  cause the pace I m working at is dangerous There s nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst I done quit chicken heads cold turkey and started slowly roasting  em  Cause that s where most of my anger is based  F    your feelings  I feel like I play for the Saints I just want to hurt you  aim for the skanks Then aim for all these fake Kanye s  Jay s  Wayne s and the Drake s I m frustrated cause ain t no more N Sync  now I m all out of wack I m all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack I m going all out in this rap s    and whatever the fallout is I m strapped for battles  suck a duck  crawl out the back  let s bar fight  Prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools flying through the air And bottles breaking  mirrors also And I ain t stopping  til the swear jar s full You done called every woman a slut  but you forgetting Sarah Marshall Oh my bad  slut And next time I show up in court I ll be naked and square a lawsuit Judge be like  That s sharp  how much that motherf   er cost you   Smart a    you lucky I don t tear it off you And jump your bones  you sexy motherf   er You so f   ing gravy  Marshall  I should start calling you au jus   Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo Evil twin  take this beat now  it s on you  I believe people can change  but only for the worse I could ve changed the world if it wasn t for this verse So satanic Kmart chains panic  Cause they can t even spin back the curse words  Cause it works when they re reversed  motherf   er  And these kids are like parrots They run around the house just like terrorists Screaming  f     s     f     Adult with a childish like arrogance Wild ever since the day I came out I was like  merits  f    that  I d rather be loud and I like swearing From the first album even the gals were like  tight lyrics  dreamy eyes  But my f   ing mouth was nightmare ish  And from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this And the opposition felt the opposite Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums Often as I can and skim through all them b    es To make sure I keep up with my competition  ha ha  Hogger of beats  hoarder of rhymes Borderline genius who s bored of his lines And that sort of defines where I m at and the way I feel now Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies  This darkness comes in me (Evil twin) Here it goes again (Evil twin) If you chose my pen that ain t me it s my evil twin He s just a friend who pops up now and again (Evil twin) So don t blame me  blame him (Evil twin) I step out and see my evil twin  he gives me an evil grin  Welcome back to the land of the living  my friend You have slept for quite some time  So who s left  Lady Gaga  Messed with the Bieber Nah  F with Christina  I ain t f   ing with either Jessica neither Simpson or Alba  my albums just sicker than struck with the fever Get the Chloraseptic  Excedrin  Aleve or Extra Strength Tylenol 3’s Feel like I m burning to death  but I m freezin  Bed written and destined to never leave the Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heather Ledger My suicide notes  barely legible read the Bottom  it s signed by The Joker Lorraine said I never can leave her She d sever my wiener I ever deceive her  F    that s     b     Give up my dick for p      I d be Jerry Mathers I d ever left it to beaver Get them titties cut off trying to mess with the cleaver Golly wally I bet he registered Jesus Ever since 1 9 9 4 6 Dresden it was definite lean My destiny went on the steps  I met Deshaun at Osborn I d never make it to sophomore I just wanted to skip school and rap  used to mop floors Flip burgers and wash dishes  but I wrote rhymes trying to get props for  em  Cause I took book smarts and swapped for  em  They were sleeping  I made them stop snorin  Made them break out the popcorn Now I ve been hip hop in its tip top form Since N W A  was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn Screaming  f    the police  like cop porn  Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped coin F    top 5  b      I m top 4 And that includes Biggie and Pac  whore And I got an evil twin  so who do you think that s 3rd and that 4th spot s for  And as crazy as I am I m much tamer than him And I m nuts  then again who the f    wants to plain Eminem  But no one s insaner than Slim  look at that evil grin (evil twin) Please come in  what was your name again   Hi  faggot Look who s back with a crab up his a   like a lobster crawled up there Two rabbits  a koala bear and a ball of hair And you re all aware I ain t got it all upstairs Guess that s why I m an addict and it s just small up there Peace to Whitney  geez  just hit me That I should call the looney police to come get me  Cause I m so sick of being the truth I wish somebody finally admit me Into a mental hospital with Britney  Oh  LMFAO  no way  ho Jose Baez couldn t beat this rap  OJ no Hooray  I m off the hook like Casey Anthony Hey ho  hey ho I sound like I m trying to sing the chorus to f   ing hip hop hooray No  I m hollering  you got bottom in like an a hole Eight and a base whether I m f   ing off that instead of your face  ho Let your low hand raise  yo  Tango  what you think  ho  Slow dancing in bowling You trying to hold hands with your homie  What  You think I m looking for romance  cause I m lonely  Change that tune  you ain t got remote chance to control me Ho  I m only vulnerable when I got a boner Superman tried to f    me over  it won t hurt Don t try to fix me  I m broke so I don t work So are you  but you re broke  cause you don t work  But all bulls    aside I hit a stride Still Shady inside  hair every bit is dyed As it used to be when I first introduced y all to my skiddish side And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize  Cause we are the same  b    ,Eminem
315,It s like I m in the dirt  digging up old hurt Tried everything to get my mind off you  it won t work All it takes is one song on the radio  you re right back on it Reminding me all over again how you just brushed me off And left me so burned  spent a lot of time trying to soul search Maybe I needed to grow up a little first Well  looks like I hit a growth spurt But I m coming for closure Don t suppose an explanation I m owed for The way that you turned your back on me Just when I may have needed you most Oh  you thought it was over You can just close the chapter And go about your life  like it was nothing You ruined mine  but you seem to be doing fine Well  I ve never recovered but tonight betcha that whatcha  Bout to go through s tougher than anything I ever have suffered Can t think of a better way to define poetic justice Can I hold grudges  Mind s saying   let it go  fu  this  Heart s saying   I will once I bury this bi  alive Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset   I flee the scene like it was my last ride You see right through Oh  you had me pegged the first time You can t see the truth But it s easier to justify What s bad is good And I hate to be the bad guy I just hate to be the bad guy  I just hate to be the bad guy  And to think I used to think you was the shh To think it was you at one time I worshiped  shh Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it  Not this time  you better go and get the sewing kit  bi  Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow  nitwit Thought some time had passed and I d forget it  forget it You left our family in shambles And you expect me to just get over him  Pretend he never existed Maybe gone  but he s not forgotten And don t think  cause he s been out the picture so long That I ve stopped the plottin  and still ain t coming to get ya You re wrong and that ish was rotten And the way you played him  same ish you did to me  cold Have you any idea the ish I ve gone through  Feelings I harbor  All this pent up resentment I hold on to Not once you called to ask me how I m doing Letters  you don t respond to  em Fu  it  I m coming to see you And gee  who better to talk to than you  The cause to my problems My life is garbage and I m  bout to take it out on you Poof  then I m gone  woosh  I flee the scene like it was my last ride You see right through Oh  you had me pegged the first time You can t see the truth But it s easier to justify What s bad is good And I hate to be the bad guy I just hate to be the bad guy (follow me  I run  I run  follow me  I run  I run) I just hate to be the bad guy (follow me  I run  I run  follow me  I run  I run)  I ve been driving around your side of this town Like nine frickin  hours and forty five minutes now Finally  I found your new address  park in your drive Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life And it s now arrived  and my mouth is full of saliva My knife is out and I m ducking on the side of your house See  it s sad it came to this point Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya But ain t here for your empathy  I don t need your apology Or your friendship or sympathy  it s revenge that I seek So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window Like I reach my full potential  I peeked Continue to peep  still bent low Then keep tapping the glass lightly  then start to crescendo Sneak all the way  round to the back porch Man  door handles unlocked  shouldn t be that easy to do this You don t plan for intruders beforehand  Surprised to see me  Cat got your tongue  Gag  chloroform rag  gag  almost hack up a lung Like you picked an axe up and swung Stick to the core plan  dragged to the back of a trunk By one of your fans  irony spectacular  huh  Now who s a f   you punk  And here s your Bronco hat  you can have that shh back  cause they suck  It s just me  you and the music now  Slim I hope you hear it  we re in the car right now Wait  here comes my favorite lyric I m the bad guy who makes fun of people that die And hey  here s a sequel to my Mathers LP Just to try to get people to buy How s this for publicity stunt  This should be fun Last album now  cause after this you ll be officially done Eminem killed by Eminem Matthew Mitchell  bitch  I even have your initials I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother  but fu  it Since you re love with your city so much I figured  what the fu   the best place you could be buried alive is right here Two more exits  time is quite near Hope we don t get stopped  no license I fear That sirens I hear  Guess ninety on the freeway wasn t the brightest idea As cops appear in my driver side mirror (Oh  God  police  ah) Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot  at least New plan  Stan Slim   chauvinist pig  drove in this big Lincoln town car  Well  gotta go  almost at the bridge  big bro  it s for you Slim  this is for him and Frank Ocean  oh  hope you can swim good Now say you hate homos again  I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend I m the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in I m your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin Nope  it s hopeless  I m the denial that you re hopelessly in When they say all of this is approaching its end But you refuse to believe that it s over  here we go all over again Back s to the wall  I m stacking up all them odds  toilet s clogged Yeah   cause I m talking a lotta shit but I m backing it all up But in my head there s a voice in the back and it hollers After the track is demolished  I am your lack of a conscience  I m the ringing in your ears I m the polyps on the back of your tonsils Eating your vocal chords after your concerts I m your time that s almost up that you haven t acknowledged Grab for some water but I m that pill that s too jagged to swallow I m the bullies you hate that you became With every f  you slaughtered Coming back on you every woman you insult  batter But the double standards you have when it comes to your daughters I represent everything you take for granted  Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper s persona s half a façade and Matthew and Stan just symbolic of you not knowing what you had  til it s gone  Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name Cameras are off  sad but it happens to all of them I m the hindsight to say   I told you so  Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow I m the future that s here to show you what happens tomorrow If you don t stop after they call you Biggest laughing stock of rap who can t call it quits When it s time to walk away I m every guilt trip the baggage you have But as you gather up all your possessions If there s anything you have left to say Unless it makes an impact then don t bother So before you rest your case Better make sure you re packing a wallop  So one last time  I m back Before it fades into black and it s all over Behold the final chapter in the saga Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle Twice  the magic that started it all Tragic portrait of an artist tortured Trapped in his own drawings Tap into thoughts Blacker and darker than anything imaginable Here goes a wild stab in the dark As we pick up where the last Mathers  left off,Eminem

321,I came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain An a  hole  that role I think I succeed fulfilling But don t think I ever stopped To think I was speaking to children Everything was happening so fast It was like I blinked  sold three million  Then it all went blank  all I remember Is feeling ridiculous  cause I was getting sick of this feeling Like I am always under attack man I could have stacked my s    list to the ceiling Women dish him but really thinking If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him  Guess I m a little bit of a hypocrite When I m ripping s     but since when did this many People ever give a s    but I had to say It s just my opinion If it contradicts how I m living Put a dick in your rear end and guess what Every time you mention a lyric  I thank you for it  For drawing more attention toward it  Cause it gave me an enormous platform of platitude Thought I was that important But you can t ignore the fact that I fought for the respect And battle for it  mad awards  act paranoid Attaboy  they told me to slow down  and I just zone out  Good luck trying to convince a blonde That s like telling Gwen Stefan  she sold out  Cause I was tryna leave  no doubt In anyone s mind one day I d go down In history think they know now Because everybody knows  Everybody knows that you re just an a  hole Everywhere that you go  people wanna go  Oh  everyone knows  Everybody knows  so don t pretend to be nice There s no place you can hide You are just an a  hole Everyone knows  everyone knows  Thanks for the support  a  hole [ scratch ] thanks for the support  a  hole Quit acting salty  I was counting on you to count me out as Asher Roth When he round a bout dissed me to shout me out Thought I was history But goddamn  honkey  that compliment s like backhanding a donkey Good way to get your a   socked in the mouth Lay em off it  But what the f    is all this thrash talking about The fight was fixed  I m back and you can t stop me You knock me down  I went down from the count I fell but the fans caught me  and now You re gonna have to beat the f   in pants off me To take my belt  word to Pacquiao  Momma said there ain t nothing else to talk about Gotta go in that ring and knock them out Or you better not come out It s poetry in motion  like Freddie Roach when he s quoting Shakespeare So what if the insults are revolting  Even Helen Keller knows life stinks You think it s a joke til you re bullet riddled But you should give little s    what I think This whole world is a mess Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest  and a Glock Just to go out watch Batman  Who needs a test to test the testicles  not that man Half of you don t got the guts and intestinal blockage Rest of you got lap bands stuck to this model Before they put bath salts and all those water bottles in Colorado So get lost  Waldo  My soul s escaping through this a  hole that is gaping A black hole that I m swallowing this track whole With a pack torn of paper But I m not taking no crap  ho Here I go down the back pole And I m changing back into that old maniac in fact there it go Trying to dip through the back door retreating  cause everybody knows  Everybody knows that you re just an a  hole Everywhere that you go  people wanna go  Oh  everyone knows  Everybody knows  so don t pretend to be nice There s no place you can hide You are just an a  hole Everyone knows  everyone knows  Holy mackeral  I m the biggest jerk on the planet earth I smack the girl off the mechanical bull  then attract the bull Thinkin  we have some magnetic pull Then scream  ICP in this b      how the f    do magnets work    Cause you re attractive  but we ain t attractable Hate to be dramatical  but I m not romantical I m making up words you can understandable  it s tragical Thinkin  some magical s    s gonna happen  That ain t practical  You crackin  a joke  it s laughable   cause me and love s like a bad combination I keep them feelings locked in a vault So it s safe to say I m uncrackable My heart is truly guarded  full body armor B     you just need a helmet because if you think you re special  you re retarded  Thinkin  you re one of a kind  like you got some platinum vagina  You re a train wreck  I got a one track mind Shorty you re fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er  Cause you been a gold digger since you were a minor  Been tryina  hunt me down like a dog   cause you re on my a   But you can t get a scent because all of my spare time is spent With my nose in this binder  so don t bother tryin  Only women that I love are my daughters And sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I m a father  and I push it farther So father forgive me if I forget to draw the line It s apparent I shouldn t of been a parent I ll never grow up So to hell with your parents  and motherf   ing father time And it ain t never gonna stop   A pessimist who transforms you to Optimus in his prime  So even if I m half dead  I m half alive Throw all my half empty gla   in a cup  now my cup is runneth over And I m about to set it on you like a motherf   ing coaster  I m goin  back to what got me here  yeah c   y  and can t not be  rude off So fear not my dear  and dry up your teardrops I m here White America s mirror  so I feel awkward and weird  You stare at me and see yourself  because you re one too You shouldn t be as shocked  because everybody knows  Everybody knows that you re just an a  hole Everywhere that you go  people wanna go  Oh  everyone knows  Everybody knows  so don t pretend to be nice There s no place you can hide You are just an a  hole Everyone knows  everyone knows,Eminem

You were just what the doctor ordered    I m beginning to feel like a Rap God  Rap God  All my people from the front to the back nod  back nod  Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box  slap box   They said I rap like a robot  so call me Rapbot    But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes  I got a laptop in my back pocket  My pen ll go off when I half c    it  Got a fat knot from that rap profit  Made a living and a killing off it  Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office  With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut sack  I m an MC still as honest  But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables  killaholic (Kill  em all with)  This slickety  gibbedy  hibbedy hip hop  You don t really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap  Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac  pack backpack rap  yep  yackidy yac  The exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I m practicing  That I ll still be able to break a motherf   in  table  Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half  Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact  How could I not blow  All I do is drop F bombs  feel my wrath of attack  Rappers are having a rough time period  here s a Maxipad  It s actually disastrously bad  For the wack while I m masterfully constructing this masterpiece as    I m beginning to feel like a Rap God  Rap God  All my people from the front to the back nod  back nod  Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box  slap box   Let me show you maintaining this s    ain t that hard  that hard    Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got  Well  to be truthful the blueprint s simply rage and youthful exuberance  Everybody loves to root for a nuisance  Hit the earth like an asteroid  did nothing but shoot for the moon since  MC s get taken to school with this music  Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme  Now I lead a new school full of students  Me  I m a product of Rakim  Lakim Shabazz  2Pac N    W A  Cube  hey  Doc  Ren  Yella  Eazy  thank you  they got Slim  Inspired enough to one day grow up  blow up and be in a position  To meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherf   in  Rock n   Roll Hall of Fame  Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames  Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame  On the wall of shame  You fags think it s all a game  til I walk a flock of flames  Off of planking  tell me what in the f    are you thinking   Little gay looking boy  So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy  You witnessing a massacre  Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy  Oy vey  that boy s gay  that s all they say looking boy  You get a thumbs up  pat on the back  And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy  Hey  looking boy  what you say looking boy   I got a  hell yeah  from Dre looking boy  I mma work for everything I have  Never ask nobody for s     get outta

Asgard    So you be Thor and I ll be Odin  you rodent  I m omnipotent  Let off then I m reloading immediately with these bombs I m totin   And I should not be woken  I m the walking dead  but I m just a talking head  a zombie floating  But I got your mom deep throating  I m out my ramen noodle  we have nothing in common  poodle  I m a doberman  pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage  pupil  It s me  my honesty s brutal  But it s honestly futile if I don t utilize what I do though  For good at least once in a while  So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle  Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times  But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned  Rappers are hungry looking at me like it s lunchtime  I know there was a time where once I  Was king of the underground  but I still rap like I m on my Pharoahe Monch grind  So I crunch rhymes  but sometimes when you combine  Appeal with the skin color of mine  You get too big and here they come trying to   Censor you like that one line I said on  I m Back  from the Marshall Mathers LP  One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine  Put  em all in a line  add an AK 47  a revolver and a nine  See if I get away with it now that I ain t as big as I was  but I ve  Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal  You re stuck in a time warp from 2004 though  And I don t know what the f    that you rhyme for  You re pointless as Rapunzel with f   ing cornrows  You re like normal  f    being normal  And I just bought a new Raygun from the future  To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad   Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad  Singin  to a man while they played piano  Man  oh man  that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel  So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day   Hey  Fab  I mma kill you   Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed  (JJ Fad)  Uh  sama lamaa duma lamaa you a  uming I m a human  What I gotta do to get it through to you I m superhuman  Innovative and I m made of rubber  So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it ll glue to you  I m never stating  more than never demonstrating  How to give a motherf   in  audience a feeling like it s levitating  Never fading  and I know that the haters are forever waiting  For the day that they can say I fell off  they d be celebrating  Cause I know the way to get  em motivated  I make elevating music  you make elevator music  Oh  he s too mainstream  Well  that s what they do when they get jealous  they confuse it  It s not hip hop  it s pop  cause I found a hella way to fuse it  With rock  shock rap with Doc  Throw on Lose Yourself and make  em lose it  I don t know how to make songs like that  I don t know what words to use  Let me know when it occurs to you  While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you  It’s curtains  I’m inadvertently hurtin  you  How many verses I gotta murder to   Prove that if you re half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh   School flunkie  pill junky  But look at the accolades the skills brung me  Full of myself  but still hungry  I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to  And I m a million leagues above you  ill when I speak in tongues  But it s still tongue in cheek  f    you  I m drunk so Satan take the f   ing wheel  I m asleep in the front seat  Bumping Heavy D and the Boys  still chunky  but funky  But in my head there s something I can feel tugging and struggling  Angels fight with devils  here s what they want from me  They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate  But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had  Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation  And understand the discrimination  But f    it  life s handing you lemons  make lemonade then  But if I can t batter the women how the f    am I supposed to bake them a cake then   Don t mistake it for Satan  It s a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas  And take a vacation to trip a broad  And make her fall on her face and don t be a retard  Be a king  Think not  why be a king when you can be a ,Eminem

330,Yeah  trying to figure out the difference But I think I think the lines are starting to get blurry  I m in a strange place I feel like Mase when he gave up the game for his faith I feel like I m caged in these chains and restraints Grinning every stranger in the place while I gaze into space  Cause I m mentally rearranging his face  I need a change of pace  cause the pace I m working at is dangerous There s nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst I done quit chicken heads cold turkey and started slowly roasting  em  Cause that s where most of my anger is based  F    your feelings  I feel like I play for the Saints I just want to hurt you  aim for the skanks Then aim for all these fake Kanye s  Jay s  Wayne s and the Drake s I m frustrated cause ain t no more N Sync  now I m all out of wack I m all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack I m going all out in this rap s    and whatever the fallout is I m strapped for battles  suck a duck  crawl out the back  let s bar fight  Prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools flying through the air And bottles breaking  mirrors also And I ain t stopping  til the swear jar s full You done called every woman a slut  but you forgetting Sarah Marshall Oh my bad  slut And next time I show up in court I ll be naked and square a lawsuit Judge be like  That s sharp  how much that motherf   er cost you   Smart a    you lucky I don t tear it off you And jump your bones  you sexy motherf   er You so f   ing gravy  Marshall  I should start calling you au jus   Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo Evil twin  take this beat now  it s on you  I believe people can change  but only for the worse I could ve changed the world if it wasn t for this verse So satanic Kmart chains panic  Cause they can t even spin back the curse words  Cause it works when they re reversed  motherf   er  And these kids are like parrots They run around the house just like terrorists Screaming  f     s     f     Adult with a childish like arrogance Wild ever since the day I came out I was like  merits  f    that  I d rather be loud and I like swearing From the first album even the gals were like  tight lyrics  dreamy eyes  But my f   ing mouth was nightmare ish  And from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this And the opposition felt the opposite Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums Often as I can and skim through all them b    es To make sure I keep up with my competition  ha ha  Hogger of beats  hoarder of rhymes Borderline genius who s bored of his lines And that sort of defines where I m at and the way I feel now Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies  This darkness comes in me (Evil twin) Here it goes again (Evil twin) If you chose my pen that ain t me it s my evil twin He s just a friend who pops up now and again (Evil twin) So don t blame me  blame him (Evil twin) I step out and see my evil twin  he gives me an evil grin  Welcome back to the land of the living  my friend You have slept for quite some time  So who s left  Lady Gaga  Messed with the Bieber Nah  F with Christina  I ain t f   ing with either Jessica neither Simpson or Alba  my albums just sicker than struck with the fever Get the Chloraseptic  Excedrin  Aleve or Extra Strength Tylenol 3’s Feel like I m burning to death  but I m freezin  Bed written and destined to never leave the Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heather Ledger My suicide notes  barely legible read the Bottom  it s signed by The Joker Lorraine said I never can leave her She d sever my wiener I ever deceive her  F    that s     b     Give up my dick for p      I d be Jerry Mathers I d ever left it to beaver Get them titties cut off trying to mess with the cleaver Golly wally I bet he registered Jesus Ever since 1 9 9 4 6 Dresden it was definite lean My destiny went on the steps  I met Deshaun at Osborn I d never make it to sophomore I just wanted to skip school and rap  used to mop floors Flip burgers and wash dishes  but I wrote rhymes trying to get props for  em  Cause I took book smarts and swapped for  em  They were sleeping  I made them stop snorin  Made them break out the popcorn Now I ve been hip hop in its tip top form Since N W A  was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn Screaming  f    the police  like cop porn  Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped coin F    top 5  b      I m top 4 And that includes Biggie and Pac  whore And I got an evil twin  so who do you think that s 3rd and that 4th spot s for  And as crazy as I am I m much tamer than him And I m nuts  then again who the f    wants to plain Eminem  But no one s insaner than Slim  look at that evil grin (evil twin) Please come in  what was your name again   Hi  faggot Look who s back with a crab up his a   like a lobster crawled up there Two rabbits  a koala bear and a ball of hair And you re all aware I ain t got it all upstairs Guess that s why I m an addict and it s just small up there Peace to Whitney  geez  just hit me That I should call the looney police to come get me  Cause I m so sick of being the truth I wish somebody finally admit me Into a mental hospital with Britney  Oh  LMFAO  no way  ho Jose Baez couldn t beat this rap  OJ no Hooray  I m off the hook like Casey Anthony Hey ho  hey ho I sound like I m trying to sing the chorus to f   ing hip hop hooray No  I m hollering  you got bottom in like an a hole Eight and a base whether I m f   ing off that instead of your face  ho Let your low hand raise  yo  Tango  what you think  ho  Slow dancing in bowling You trying to hold hands with your homie  What  You think I m looking for romance  cause I m lonely  Change that tune  you ain t got remote chance to control me Ho  I m only vulnerable when I got a boner Superman tried to f    me over  it won t hurt Don t try to fix me  I m broke so I don t work So are you  but you re broke  cause you don t work  But all bulls    aside I hit a stride Still Shady inside  hair every bit is dyed As it used to be when I first introduced y all to my skiddish side And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize  Cause we are the same  b    ,Eminem

336,It s like I m in the dirt  digging up old hurt  Tried everything to get my mind off you  it won t work  All it takes is one song on the radio you re right back on it  Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off  And left me so burned  spent a lot of time trying to soul search  Maybe I needed to grow up a little first  Looks like I hit a growth spurt  But I am coming for closure  Don t suppose an explanation I m owed for  The way that you turned your back on me  Just when I may have needed you most  Oh  you thought it was over  You can just close the chapter  And go about your life  like it was nothing  You ruined mine  but you seem to be doing fine  I d never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha   Bout to go through s tougher than anything I ever have suffered  Can t think of a better way to define poetic justice  Can I hold grudges  mind is saying:  let it go  f ck this   Heart is saying:  I will once I bury this bitch alive  Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset     I flee the scene like it was my last ride  You see right through  Oh  you had me pegged the first time  You can t see the truth  But it s easier to justify  What s bad is good  And I hate to be the bad guy  I just hate to be the bad guy    And to think I used to think you was the shit  bitch  To think it was you at one time I worshiped  shit  Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it   Not this time  you better go and get sewing kit  bitch  Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow  nitwit  Thought some time had past and I forget it  forget it   You left our family in shambles  You expect me to just get over him  Pretend he never existed  Maybe gone  but he s not forgotten  And don t think  cause he s been out the pictures so long  That I ve stopped the plottin  and still ain t coming to get ya  You re wrong and that shit was rotten  And the way you played him  same shit you did to me  Have you any idea that shit I ve gone through   Feelings I harbor  all this pain of resentment I hold on to  Not once you called to ask me how I m doing  Letters  you don t respond to  em  F ck it  I m coming to see you  And gee who better to talk to than you   The cause to my problems  My life is garbage and I m  bout to take it out on you  Poof  then I m gone    I flee the scene like it was my last ride  You see right through  Oh  you had me pegged the first time  You can t see the truth  But it s easier to justify  What s bad is good  And I hate to be the bad guy  I just hate to be the bad guy  Hate to be the bad guy    I ve been driving around your side of the town  Like nine frickin  hours and forty five minutes now  Finally I found your new address  park in your drive  Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life  And it s now arrived  and my mouth is full of saliva  My knife is out and I m ducking on the side of your house  See  it s sad it came to this point  Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya  But ain t here for ya empathy  I don t need your apology  Or your friendship of sympathy  it s revenge that I seek  So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window  Like I reach my full potential  I peeked  Continue to peep  still bent low  Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo  Sneak all the way  round to the back porch  Man  door handles unlocked  shouldn t be that easy to do this  You don t plan for intruders before hand   Surprised to see me  Cat got your tongue   Gag  chloroform rag  gag almost hack of a lung  Like you picked up an axe up and then swung  Stick to the core plan  drag to the back of a trunk  By one of your fans  irony spectacular  huh   Now who s a faggot  you punk   And here s your Bronco hat  you can have that shit back as they suck    It s just me  you and the music now  Slim  I hope you hear it we are in a car right now  Wait  here comes my favorite lyric  I m the bad guy who makes fun of people that die  And hey  here s a sequel to my Mathers LP  Just to try to get people to buy  How s this for publicity stunt  This should be fun  Last album now  cause after this you ll be officially done  Eminem killed by Eminem  Matthew Mitchell  bitch  I even have your initials  I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother  but f ck it  Since you love your city so much  I figured  what the f ck the best place you could be buried alive is right here  Two more exits  town is quite near  I hope we don t get stopped  no license I fear  That sirens I hear  Guess 90 on the freeway wasn t the brightest idea  As cops appear in my driver side mirror  (Help  god police  ah  )  Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial  New plan Stan  Slim  chauvinist pig drove in this big  Lincoln town car  Well gotta go  almost at the bridge  haha big bro it s for you  Slim  this is for him and Frank Ocean  hope you can swim good   Now say you hate homos again     I also represent anyone normally seen on the end of these jokes of a beat  I m the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in  I m your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen  Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin  No  it s hopeless  I m the denial that you re hopelessly in  When they say all of this is approaching its end  But you refuse to believe that it s over  here we go all over again    Backs to the wall  I’m stacking up all them odds  toilets clogged  Yeah  cause I’m talking a lot of shit but I’m backing it all up  But in my head there’s a voice in the back and it hollas  After the track is demolished  I am your lack of a conscience  I’m the ringing in your ears  I’m the polyps on the back of your tonsils  Eating your vocal chords after your concerts  I’m your time that’s almost up that you haven’t acknowledged  Grab for some water but I’m that pill that’s too jagged to swallow  I’m the bullies you hate that you became  With every faggot you slaughtered  Coming back on you every woman you insult there  With the double standards you have when it comes to your daughters  I represent everything you take for granted   Cause Marshall Mather’s the rapper’s persona’s have a facade and  Matthew and Stan’s just symbolic of you not knowing what you had until it’s gone   Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name  Cameras are off  sad but it happens to all of them   I m the hindsight to say  “I told you so ”  Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow  I m the future that s here to show you what happens tomorrow  If you don’t stop after they call you  The biggest laughing stock of rap who can’t call it quits  But it’s time to walk away  I’m ever guilt trip the baggage you had  But as you gather up all your possessions  If there s anything you have left to say  Unless it makes an impact don t bother  So before you rest your case  Better make sure you re packing a wallop    So one last time  I’m back  Before it fades into black and it’s all over  Behold the final chapter in the saga  Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle  Twice the magic that started it all  Tragic portrait of an artist tortured  Trapped in his own drawings  Tap into thoughts  Blacker and darker than anything imaginable  Here goes a wild stab in the dark  As we pick up the last Mathers’ left off,Eminem

342,I came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain An asshole  that role I think I succeed fulfilling But don t think I ever stopped To think I was speaking to children Everything was happening so fast It was like I blinked  sold three million  Then it all went blank  all I remember Is feeling ridiculous  cause I was getting sick of this feeling Like I am always under attack man I could have stacked my shit list to the ceiling Women dish him but really thinking If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him  Guess I m a little bit of a hypocrite When I m ripping shit  but since when did this many People ever give a shit but I had to say It s just my opinion If it contradicts how I m living Put a dick in your rear end and guess what Every time you mention a lyric  I thank you for it  For drawing more attention toward it  Cause it gave me an enormous platform of platitude Thought I was that important But you can t ignore the fact that I fought for the respect And battle for it  mad awards  act paranoid Attaboy  they told me to slow down  and I just zone out  Good luck trying to convince a blonde That s like telling Gwen Stefan  she sold out  Cause I was tryna leave  no doubt In anyone s mind one day I d go down In history think they know now Because everybody knows  Everybody knows that you re just an asshole Everywhere that you go  people wanna go  Oh  everyone knows  Everybody knows  so don t pretend to be nice There s no place you can hide You are just an asshole Everyone knows  everyone knows  Thanks for the support  asshole [ scratch ] thanks for the support  asshole Quit acting salty  I was counting on you to count me out as Asher Roth When he round a bout dissed me to shout me out Thought I was history But goddamn  honkey  that compliment s like backhanding a donkey Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth Lay em off it  But what the f ck is all this thrash talking about The fight was fixed  I m back and you can t stop me You knock me down  I went down from the count I fell but the fans caught me  and now You re gonna have to beat the fuckin pants off me To take my belt  word to Pacquiao  Momma said there ain t nothing else to talk about Gotta go in that ring and knock them out Or you better not come out It s poetry in motion  like Freddie Roach when he s quoting Shakespeare So what if the insults are revolting  Even Helen Keller knows life stinks You think it s a joke til you re bullet riddled But you should give little shit what I think This whole world is a mess Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest  and a Glock Just to go out watch Batman  Who needs a test to test the testicles  not that man Half of you don t got the guts and intestinal blockage Rest of you got lap bands stuck to this model Before they put bath salts and all those water bottles in Colorado So get lost  Waldo  My soul s escaping through this asshole that is gaping A black hole that I m swallowing this track whole With a pack torn of paper But I m not taking no crap  ho Here I go down the back pole And I m changing back into that old maniac in fact there it go Trying to dip through the back door retreating  cause everybody knows  Everybody knows that you re just an asshole Everywhere that you go  people wanna go  Oh  everyone knows  Everybody knows  so don t pretend to be nice There s no place you can hide You are just an asshole Everyone knows  everyone knows  Holy mackeral  I m the biggest jerk on the planet earth I smack the girl off the mechanical bull  then attract the bull Thinkin  we have some magnetic pull Then scream  ICP in this bitch  how the f ck do magnets work    Cause you re attractive  but we ain t attractable Hate to be dramatical  but I m not romantical I m making up words you can understandable  it s tragical Thinkin  some magical shit s gonna happen  That ain t practical  You crackin  a joke  it s laughable   cause me and love s like a bad combination I keep them feelings locked in a vault So it s safe to say I m uncrackable My heart is truly guarded  full body armor Bitch you just need a helmet because if you think you re special  you re retarded  Thinkin  you re one of a kind  like you got some platinum vagina  You re a train wreck  I got a one track mind Shorty you re fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er  Cause you been a gold digger since you were a minor  Been tryina  hunt me down like a dog   cause you re on my ass But you can t get a scent because all of my spare time is spent With my nose in this binder  so don t bother tryin  Only women that I love are my daughters And sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I m a father  and I push it farther So father forgive me if I forget to draw the line It s apparent I shouldn t of been a parent I ll never grow up So to hell with your parents  and motherfucking father time And it ain t never gonna stop   A pessimist who transforms you to Optimus in his prime  So even if I m half dead  I m half alive Throw all my half empty glass in a cup  now my cup is runneth over And I m about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster  I m goin  back to what got me here  yeah cocky  and can t not be  rude off So fear not my dear  and dry up your teardrops I m here White America s mirror  so I feel awkward and weird  You stare at me and see yourself  because you re one too You shouldn t be as shocked  because everybody knows  Everybody knows that you re just an asshole Everywhere that you go  people wanna go  Oh  everyone knows  Everybody knows  so don t pretend to be nice There s

You were just what the doctor ordered    I m beginning to feel like a Rap God  Rap God  All my people from the front to the back nod  back nod  Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box  slap box   They said I rap like a robot  so call me Rapbot    But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes  I got a laptop in my back pocket  My pen ll go off when I half cock it  Got a fat knot from that rap profit  Made a living and a killing off it  Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office  With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut sack  I m an MC still as honest  But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables  killaholic (Kill  em all with)  This slickety  gibbedy  hibbedy hip hop  You don t really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap  Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac  pack backpack rap  yep  yackidy yac  The exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I m practicing  That I ll still be able to break a motherfuckin  table  Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half  Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact  How could I not blow  All I do is drop F bombs  feel my wrath of attack  Rappers

me  my honesty s brutal  But it s honestly futile if I don t utilize what I do though  For good at least once in a while  So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle  Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times  But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned  Rappers are hungry looking at me like it s lunchtime  I know there was a time where once I  Was king of the underground  but I still rap like I m on my Pharoahe Monch grind  So I crunch rhymes  but sometimes when you combine  Appeal with the skin color of mine  You get too big and here they come trying to   Censor you like that one line I said on  I m Back  from the Marshall Mathers LP  One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine  Put  em all in a line  add an AK 47  a revolver and a nine  See if I get away with it now that I ain t as big as I was  but I ve  Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal  You re stuck in a time warp from 2004 though  And I don t know what the f ck that you rhyme for  You re pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows  You re like normal  f ck being normal  And I just bought a new Raygun from the future  To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad   Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad  Singin  to a man while they played piano  Man  oh man  that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel  So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day   Hey  Fab  I mma kill you   Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed  (JJ Fad)  Uh  sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I m a human  What I gotta do to get it through to you I m superhuman  Innovative and I m made of rubber  So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it ll glue to you  I m never stating  more than never demonstrating  How to give a motherfuckin  audience a feeling like it s levitating  Never fading  and I know that the haters are forever waiting  For the day that they can say I fell off  they d be celebrating  Cause I know the way to get  em motivated  I make elevating music  you make elevator music  Oh  he s too mainstream  Well  that s what they do when they get jealous  they confuse it  It s not hip hop  it s pop  cause I found a hella way to fuse it  With rock  shock rap with Doc  Throw on Lose Yourself and make  em lose it  I don t know how to make songs like that  I don t know what words to use  Let me know when it occurs to you  While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you  It’s curtains  I’m inadvertently hurtin  you  How many verses I gotta murder to   Prove that if you re half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh   School flunkie  pill junky  But look at the accolades the skills brung me  Full of myself  but still hungry  I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to  And I m a million leagues above you  ill when I speak in tongues  But it s still tongue in cheek  f ck you  I m drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel  I m asleep in the front seat  Bumping Heavy D and the Boys  still chunky  but funky  But in my head there s something I can feel tugging and struggling  Angels fight with devils  here s what they want from me  They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate  But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had  Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation  And understand the discrimination  But f ck it  life s handing you lemons  make lemonade then  But if I can t batter the women how the f ck am I supposed to bake them a cake then   Don t mistake it for Satan  It s a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas  And take a vacation to trip a broad  And make her fall on her face and don t be a retard  Be a king  Think not  why be a king when you can be a,Eminem

Often as I can and skim through all them bitches To make sure I keep up with my competition  ha ha  Hogger of beats  hoarder of rhymes Borderline genius who s bored of his lines And that sort of defines where I m at and the way I feel now Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies  This darkness comes in me (Evil twin) Here it goes again (Evil twin) If you chose my pen that

the popcorn Now I ve been hip hop in its tip top form Since N W A  was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn Screaming  f ck the police  like cop porn  Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped coin F ck top 5  bitch  I m top 4 And that includes Biggie and Pac  whore And I got an evil twin  so who do you think that s 3rd and that 4th spot s for  And as crazy as I am I m much tamer

399,Ayo  before I start this song man  I just wanna  thank everybody for being so patient  And bearing with me over these last couple of years  While I figure this shit out    Is anybody out there  It feels like I m talking to myself  No one seems to know my struggle  and everything I ve come from  Can anybody hear me  Yeah  I guess I keep talking to myself  It feels like I m going insane  am I the one whose crazy   (So why in the world  do I feel so alone   Nobody but me  I m on my own  Is there anyone out there  who feels the way I feel   If there is  let me hear just so I know that I m not the only one)    I went away I guess and opened up some lanes  But there was no one who even knew I was going through  growing pains  Hatred was flowing through my veins  on the verge of going insane  I almost made a song dissing Lil Wayne  It s like I was jealous of him  cause of the attention he was gettin   I felt horrible about myself  he was spittin   And I wasn t  anyone who was buzzin  back then coulda got it  Almost went at Kanye too   God it feels like I m going psychotic  thank God that I didn t do it  I da had my ass handed to me  and I knew it  But Proof isn t here to see me through it  I m in the booth  popping another pill  tryna talk myself into it  Are you stupid  You re gon  start dissing people for no reason    Specially when you can t even write a decent punchline even   You re lying to yourself  you re slowly dying  You re denying your health is declining with your self esteem  You re crying out for help    Is anybody out there  It feels like I m talking to myself  No one seems to know my struggle  and everything I ve come from  Can anybody hear me  Yeah  I guess I keep talking to myself  It feels like I m going insane  am I the one whose crazy   (So why in the world  do I feel so alone   Nobody but me  I m on my own  Is there anyone out there  who feels the way I feel   If there is  let me hear just so I know that I m not the only one)    Marshall you re no longer the man  that s a bitter pill to swallow  All I know is I m wallowing  self loathing and hollow  Bottoms up on the pill bottle  maybe I ll hit my bottom tomorrow  My sorrow echoes in this hall though  But I must be talking to the wall though I don t see nobody else (I guess I keep talking to myself)  But all these other rappers suck is all that I know  I ve turned into a hater  I put up a false bravado  But Marshall is not an egomaniac  that s not his motto  He s not a desperado  he s desperate  his thoughts are bottled  Inside him  one foot on the brake  one on the throttle  Falling asleep with writer s block in the parking lot of McDonald s  But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something  bout it  Admit you got a problem  your brain is clouded  you pouted  Long enough  it isn t them it s you you fucking baby  Quit worrying  bout what they do and do Shady  I m fucking going crazy    Is anybody out there  It feels like I m talking to myself  No one seems to know my struggle  and everything I ve come from  Can anybody hear me  Yeah  I guess I keep talking to myself  It feels like I m going insane  am I the one whose crazy   (So why in the world  do I feel so alone   Nobody but me  I m on my own  Is there anyone out there  who feels the way I feel   If there is  let me hear just so I know that I m not the only one)    So I picked myself off the ground and fucking swam  fore I drowned  Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice  suffice  this time around  It s different  them last two albums didn t count  Encore I was on drugs  Relapse I was flushing  em out  I ve come to make it up to ya now  no more fucking around  I got something to prove to fans  cause I feel like I let  em down  So please accept my apology  I finally feel like I m back to normal  I feel like me again  let me formally  Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don t know  The new me s back to the old me and homie I don t show no  Signs of slowing up  oh and I m blowing up all over my life is no longer a movie but the show ain t over homos  I m back with a vengeance homie  Weezy keep ya head up  T I  keep ya head up  Kanye keep ya head up  don t let up  Just keep slaying  em  rest in peace to DJ AM   Cause I know what it s like  I struggle with this shit every single day and um    Is anybody out there  It feels like I m talking to myself  No one seems to know my struggle  and everything I ve come from  Can anybody hear me  Yeah  I guess I keep talking to myself  It feels like I m going insane  am I the one whose crazy   (So why in the world  do I feel so alone   Nobody but me  I m on my own  Is there anyone out there  who feels the way I feel   If there is  let me hear just so I know that I m not the only one)    So there it is  damn  Feels like I just woke up or something  I guess I just  forgot who the f ck I was man  Ayo  and to anybody I thought about going at  It was never nothing personal  It was just some shit I was going through  And to everybody else  I m back  Ha ha,Eminem

424, Cause sometimes you just feel tired  you feel weak  And when you feel weak you feel like you want to just give up    But you gotta search within you  you gotta find that inner strength  And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up  And not be a quitter  no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse     Til I collapse I m spilling these raps long as you feel  em   Til the day that I drop you ll never say that I m not killing  em   Cause when I am not then I m a stop pinning them  And I am not hip hop and I m just not Eminem  Subliminal thoughts when I m stop sending them  Women are caught in webs spin and hock venom  Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin  to stop  Amoxicillin is just not real enough  The criminal cop killing hip hop filling a  Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners  You re coming with me  feel it or not  You re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us  You hear it a lot  lyrics that shock  is it a miracle  Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up  For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up  You Bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a f ck     Til the roof comes off  till the lights go out   Til my legs give out  can t shut my mouth    Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps  I m a rip this shit till my bone collapse      Til the roof comes off  till the lights go out   Til my legs give out  can t shut my mouth    Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps  I m a rip this shit till my bone collapse     Music is like magic there s a certain feeling you get  When you re real and you spit and people are feeling your shit  This is your moment and every single minute you spittin   Trying to hold onto it  cause you may never get it again  So while you re in it try to get as much shit as you can  And when your run is over just admit when it s at its end   Cause I m at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in  I got a list  here s the order of my list that it s in;  It goes  Reggie  Jay Z  Tupac and Biggie  Andre from Outkast  Jada  Kurupt  Nas and then me  But in this industry I m the cause of a lot of envy  So when I m not put on this list the shit does not offend me  That s why you see me walk around like nothing s bothering me  Even though half you people got a fuckin  problem with me  You hate it but you know respect you ve got to give me  The press s wet dream like Bobby and Whitney  Nate hit me     Til the roof comes off  till the lights go out   Til my legs give out  can t shut my mouth    Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps  I m a rip this shit till my bone collapse      Til the roof comes off  till the lights go out   Til my legs give out  can t shut my mouth    Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps  I m a rip this shit till my bone collapse     Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC s heart  What is he thinking  Enough to not go against me  smart  And its absurd how people hang on every word  I ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve  But I ll never be served my spot is forever reserved  If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first   Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse  That s why I m clever when I put together every verse  My thoughts are sporadic  I act like I m an addict  I rap like I m addicted to smack like I m Kim Mathers  But I don t want to go forth and back in constant battles  The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers   So this is like a full blown attack I m launching at  em  The track is on some battling raps who want some static   Cause I don t really think that the fact that I m Slim matters  A plaque of platinum status is whack if I m not the baddest     Til the roof comes off  till the lights go out   Til my legs give out  can t shut my mouth    Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps  I m a rip this shit till my bone collapse      Til the roof comes off  till the lights go out   Til my legs give out  can t shut my mouth    Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps  I m a rip this shit till my bone collapse     Until the roof (Until the roof)  The roof comes off (The roof comes off)  Until my legs (Until my legs)  Give out from underneath me (Underneath me  I)    I will not fall  I will stand tall  Feels like no one can beat me,Eminem

Pinching nurse s asses when I m jacking off with Jergens  And I m jerking  but this whole bag of Viagra isn t working  And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking  He could be working at Burger

457,Ayo  before I start this song man  I just wanna  thank everybody for being so patient  And bearing with me over these last couple of years  While I figure this shit out    Is anybody out there  It feels like I m talking to myself  No one seems to know my struggle  and everything I ve come from  Can anybody hear me  Yeah  I guess I keep talking to myself  It feels like I m going insane  am I the one whose crazy   (So why in the world  do I feel so alone   Nobody but me  I m on my own  Is there anyone out there  who feels the way I feel   If there is  let me hear just so I know that I m not the only one)    I went away I guess and opened up some lanes  But there was no one who even knew I was going through  growing pains  Hatred was flowing through my veins  on the verge of going insane  I almost made a song dissing Lil Wayne  It s like I was jealous of him  cause of the attention he was gettin   I felt horrible about myself  he was spittin   And I wasn t  anyone who was buzzin  back then coulda got it  Almost went at Kanye too   God it feels like I m going psychotic  thank God that I didn t do it  I da had my ass handed to me  and I knew it  But Proof isn t here to see me through it  I m in the booth  popping another pill  tryna talk myself into it  Are you stupid  You re gon  start dissing people for no reason    Specially when you can t even write a decent punchline even   You re lying to yourself  you re slowly dying  You re denying your health is declining with your self esteem  You re crying out for help    Is anybody out there  It feels like I m talking to myself  No one seems to know my struggle  and everything I ve come from  Can anybody hear me  Yeah  I guess I keep talking to myself  It feels like I m going insane  am I the one whose crazy   (So why in the world  do I feel so alone   Nobody but me  I m on my own  Is there anyone out there  who feels the way I feel   If there is  let me hear just so I know that I m not the only one)    Marshall you re no longer the man  that s a bitter pill to swallow  All I know is I m wallowing  self loathing and hollow  Bottoms up on the pill bottle  maybe I ll hit my bottom tomorrow  My sorrow echoes in this hall though  But I must be talking to the wall though I don t see nobody else (I guess I keep talking to myself)  But all these other rappers suck is all that I know  I ve turned into a hater  I put up a false bravado  But Marshall is not an egomaniac  that s not his motto  He s not a desperado  he s desperate  his thoughts are bottled  Inside him  one foot on the brake  one on the throttle  Falling asleep with writer s block in the parking lot of McDonald s  But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something  bout it  Admit you got a problem  your brain is clouded  you pouted  Long enough  it isn t them it s you you fucking baby  Quit worrying  bout what they do and do Shady  I m fucking going crazy    Is anybody out there  It feels like I m talking to myself  No one seems to know my struggle  and everything I ve come from  Can anybody hear me  Yeah  I guess I keep talking to myself  It feels like I m going insane  am I the one whose crazy   (So why in the world  do I feel so alone   Nobody but me  I m on my own  Is there anyone out there  who feels the way I feel   If there is  let me hear just so I know that I m not the only one)    So I picked myself off the ground and fucking swam  fore I drowned  Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice  suffice  this time around  It s different  them last two albums didn t count  Encore I was on drugs  Relapse I was flushing  em out  I ve come to make it up to ya now  no more fucking around  I got something to prove to fans  cause I feel like I let  em down  So please accept my apology  I finally feel like I m back to normal  I feel like me again  let me formally  Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don t know  The new me s back to the old me and homie I don t show no  Signs of slowing up  oh and I m blowing up

I almost made a song dissing Lil Wayne  It s like I was jealous of him  cause of the attention he was gettin   I felt horrible about myself  he was spittin   And I wasn t  anyone who was buzzin  back then coulda got it  Almost went at Kanye too   God it feels like I m going psychotic  thank God that I didn t do it  I da had my ass handed to me  and I knew it  But Proof isn t here to see me through it  I m in the booth  popping another pill  tryna talk myself into it  Are you stupid  You re gon  start dissing people for no reason    Specially when you can t even write a decent punchline even   You re lying to yourself  you re slowly dying  You re denying your health is declining with your self esteem  You re crying out for help    Is anybody out there  It feels like I m talking to myself

though  But I must be talking to the wall though I don t see nobody else (I guess I keep talking to myself)  But all these other rappers suck is all that I know  I ve turned into a hater  I put up a false bravado  But Marshall is not an egomaniac  that s not his motto  He s not a desperado  he s desperate  his thoughts are bottled  Inside him  one foot on the brake  one on the throttle  Falling asleep with writer s block in the parking lot of McDonald s  But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something  bout it  Admit you got a problem  your brain is clouded  you pouted  Long enough  it isn t them it s you you fucking baby  Quit worrying  bout what they do and do Shady  I m fucking going crazy    Is anybody out there  It feels like I m talking to myself  No one seems to know my struggle  and everything I ve come from  Can anybody hear me  Yeah  I guess I keep talking to myself  It feels like I m going insane  am I the one whose crazy   (So why in the world  do I feel so alone   Nobody but me  I m on my own  Is there anyone out there  who feels the way I feel   If there is  let me hear just so I know that I m not the only one)    So I picked myself off the ground and

90,Take off my shirt  loosen the buttons and undo my skirt Stare at myself in the mirror Take me apart  piece by piece Sorrow decrease  pressure release  I put in work Did more than called upon  more than deserved When it was over  did I wind up hurt  Yes  but it taught me  before a decision  ask this question first  Who am I living for  Is this my limit  Can I endure some more  Chances are given  question existing Who am I living for  Is this my limit  Can I endure some more  Chances are given  question existing  Take off my cool Show them that under here  I m just like you Do the mistakes that may make me a fool Or a human with loss  And with them a loss  round of applause Take the abuse  sometimes it feels like they want me to lose It s entertainment  is that an excuse  No  but the question that lingers  whether win or lose  Who am I living for  Is this my limit  Can I endure some more  Chances are given  question existing Who am I living for  Is this my limit  Can I endure some more  Chances are given  question existing  Dear diary  and to all them Entertain is something I do for a living It s not who I am  I d like to think that I m pretty normal I laugh  I get mad  I hurt  I think I suck sometimes  But when you re in the spotlight  everything seems good Sometimes I feel like I have it worst  Cause I have to always keep my guard up I don t know who to trust I don t know who wants to date me for who I am Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am  Who am I living for  Is this my limit  Can I endure some more  Chances are given  question existing Who am I living for  Is this my limit  Can I endure some more  Chances are given  question existing ,Rihanna
